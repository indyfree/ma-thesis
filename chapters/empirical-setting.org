This research is embedded in the German carsharing and electricity markets.
Germany is a suitable testbed, since it has a comparably high share of
renewables in its energy mix and is pushing for an energy turnaround (German:
/Energiewende/) since 2010 cite:bmu10_energ_concep_envir_sound_reliab_affor
The high renewable energy content in the energy mix causes electricity prices to
be volatile, which makes Germany an attractive location for the use of
VPPs.

Germany is home to the carsharing providers Car2Go[fn:1] and DriveNow[fn:2],
which operate large EV fleets across the globe. It has been argued that electric
carsharing can simultaneously solve several traditional mobility and
environmental problems and are an important element of future smart cities
cite:firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities. Further, it is widely
regarded that the future of mobility will be electric, shared, smart and
eventually autonomous cite:burns13_sustain_mobil,sterling18_three_revol.
Carsharing providers are already contributing to the first two points by
operating large fleets of electric vehicles. This research addresses the third
point: Using electric carsharing fleets to smartly participate in electricity
markets. Carsharing providers, like Car2Go and DriveNow, operate their
carsharing fleets in a free-float model, which allows customers to pick up and
drop vehicles at any place within the operating zone of the provider.
\red{Free float carsharing is inherently uncertain, additional challenge.}
Customers pay by the minute and are offered incentives to park the EVs at
charging stations at the end of their trip.


# NOTE: Further description how data was collected? API, 5 minutes, etc..?
We obtained real-world trip data from Daimler's carsharing service Car2Go.
Additionally, we collected freely available balancing market data from the GCRM
platform website https://regelleistung.net. The data of the EPEX Spot market
have kindly been provided by ProCom GmbH[fn:3] for research purposes. In the
next chapters the different datasets are described, as well the most important
processing steps outlined.

** Electronic Vehicle Fleet Data label:sec-data-car2go
# NOTE: Here only description of data, no general blabla
The Car2Go dataset consists of GPS data of around 500 Smart ED3 Fortwo vehicles
in Stuttgart. These subcompact cars are equipped with a 17.6kWh battery and a
standard 3.6kW on-board charger. They fully charge in about six to seven hours
and can reach a maximum driving distance of 145km according to the manufacturer.
When equipped with an additional 22kW fast charger the charging time reduces to
about an hour.

# TODO: Include trip prices
#+INCLUDE: "~/uni/ma-thesis/template/car2go_tables.tex" export latex

# TODO: Exact number of charging stations, real or infered?
In Table ref:table-car2go-raw the raw data is displayed, as we have obtained it
by Car2Go. The dataset contains spatio-temporal attributes, such as timestamp,
coordinates, and the address of the EVs in 5 minute intervals. Additionally,
status attributes of the interior and exterior are given (not displayed).
Especially relevant for our research is the state of charge ($SoC$, in %) and
information whether the EV is plugged into a charging station. Note that the
data only contain EVs that are /available for rent/, i.e., they are not
currently rented out by a customer. EVs which are parked at a charging station
are also not available until they have charged up to approximately 70% SoC. For
further analysis, individual trips had to be reconstructed using the GPS data of
the cars, moreover we inferred trip distances and trips prices based on Car2Go
specifications. See Appendix ref:app-data-processing for a detailed listing of
the executed preprocessing steps.

** Balancing Market Data label:sec-data-balancing
# TODO: Consistent wording: tender/auction tender period = weekly, daily;
# segments, intervals, products, time windows
In this research, we use market balancing data from the German secondary reserve
market. The following chapter will give an overview of the dataset and
preprocessing steps that were taken. The data encompasses weekly lists of
anonymized bids between 01.06.2016 and 01.01.2018 and a dataset of activated
control reserve in Germany during the same period. For a detailed description
about the market design of balancing markets refer to Chapter
ref:sec-balancing-market.

The bidding data consists of the traded electricity product, the offered
capacity $\Pb{}$ (MW), the capacity price $\cp{}$ ($\emw$), and the
energy price $\ep{}$ ($\emwh$) of each bid. Four different products
are traded, which are a combination of positive control reserve (feed
electricity into the grid) or negative control reserve (take electricity from
the grid) and the provided time segment (peak or non-peak hours). Since negative
prices are allowed on the secondary operating reserve market, the payment
direction is included as well. Moreover, information about the amount of
capacity that was accepted, i.e., either partially or fully, is listed. Bids,
which were not accepted by the TSOs are not listed. An exemplary excerpt of the
dataset is displayed in Table ref:table-operating-reserve.

In this study, we assume that bidding on 15-minute intervals in secondary
operating reserve auctions will be possible in future energy markets. As
mentioned in Chapter ref:sec-balancing-market, the market design of the GCRM
secondary operating reserve tender was adjusted in 2017. Daily tenders with
4-hour bidding intervals were introduced in favor of weekly tenders with only
two time segments. This change represents the trend by the TSOs to change the
market design in order to better include RES into the operating reserve markets
cite:agricola14_dena_ancil_servic_study. Due to the volatility of renewable
electricity generation, providers are naturally dependent on accurate short-term
forecasts, which are only possible with short tender periods and fine-grained
bidding intervals.

# NOTE: Mentioned Ascending order of bids
# TODO: Mention assumption that bids >== critical price get accepted
# Here or in bidding strategy section?
In order to estimate the upper bound of profits that the EV fleet can earn by
participating in the secondary operating reserve market, the /critical prices/
$\ccp{}$ and $\cep{}$ were determined for each auctioned interval. Following
textcite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ, we define $\ccp{}$
($\emw$) as the capacity price of the bid that was just barely
accepted, whereas $\cep{}$ ($\emwh$) is the highest energy price
that was payed for activated control reserve during that interval. For every
15-minute interval within the given tender period of one week, the activated
control reserve in that interval was matched with the accepted bids in that
tender period. At the point where supply, i.e., offered capacity of bids, met
demand, i.e., activated control reserve, the critical price $\cep{}$ was
determined.

/Example/: The assumed critical prices for the secondary operating reserve
tender interval of the 6^{th} December 2017 between 08:00 and 08:15 are obtained
as follows: Three suppliers submitted a reserve capacity of 5MW, 15MW and 22MW
respectively (see Table ref:table-operating-reserve). The critical capacity
price $\ccp{}\!=\!200.3\emw$ is determined by the capacity price of the last
(third) accepted bid in that time segment. The TSO reported that 18MW of control
reserve were activated between 08:00 and 08:15. Hence, the second bid determines
the critical energy price $\cep{}\!=\!251\emwh$, as control reserve capacity
gets activated according to ascending order of the submitted energy prices. In
this example the second bidder would get compensated with:
$R\!=\!R^c + R^e\!=\!(10.73\emw\!\times\!15\mw) +
(251\emwh\!\times13\mw\!\times\!0.25\text{h})\!=\! 976.7\eur$. Note that
the second bidder get compensated for providing 13MW for 15 minutes (0.25h),
instead of the submitted 15MW, since in total only 18MW of control capacity was
activated, which was partly fulfilled by the 5MW of the first bidder.

# TODO: Trading windows times, Other types of orders, How are trades matched (equal, lower, higher)
# TODO: Mention product == units!
# TODO: Figure about prices developments over the day? Compare balancing & intraday?

The data from the EPEX Spot Intraday Continuous encompass order books and
executed trades from 01.06.2016 until 01.01.2018. An extract of the data can be
found in Appendix ref:app-data-tables. The list of trades contains information
on the unit price $\up{}$ ($\emwh$), the quantity (kW) and the traded product
(hourly, quarterly or block). In this research, we focus on quarterly product
times (15-minute intervals), as they provide the highest flexibility. Fleet
controllers can promptly react to fluctuant electricity demand of the EV fleet
by accurately adjusting the bid quantities. Future research could also consider
other electricity products if lower prices justify decreased flexibility at that
point in time. Additionally, the TSOs of the buyer and seller are listed in the
dataset. They are only relevant if special conditions between TSO apply, for
example when delivering electricity to other countries.

#+CAPTION[Critical electricity prices]: Daily critical electricity market prices (average, standard deviation) from June 6, 2016 to January 1, 2018. Highly volatile prices, e.g., between 12:00 and 14:00, illustrate the benefits of an integrated trading strategy, which considers trading on both markets depending on the market conditions.

On the spot market, electricity trades can have a very short lead time of up to
5 minutes before delivery. This market characteristic is beneficial for our
proposed trading strategy, since it allows the EV to procure electricity in
almost real time. The controller can submit bids to the market, with accurate
estimations of available charging capacity up to five minutes ahead. Similarly
to the balancing market, the critical price $\cup{}$ has to be determined for
all intraday trading intervals. The critical unit price $\cup{}$ is defined as
the lowest price of all executed trades.
\begin{equation*}
    \cup{} \defeq \min_{t \in \cal{T}} \up{t} \text{ ,}
\end{equation*}
where $\cal{T}$ is the set of all trades in a bidding interval. /Example:/ The
critical unit price of the trades listed in Appendix ref:app-data-tables is
$\cup{} \!=\!51.00 \emwh$ (trades 8031392, 8031387 and 8031375). All buyers that
submitted bids with a price higher than the critical unit price, successfully
procured electricity. Hence, accurate forecasts of the critical price allow to
optimize the bidding behavior. For a detailed description of the intraday
continuous market see Chapter ref:sec-spot-market.
