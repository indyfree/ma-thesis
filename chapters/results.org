* Results
The following chapter will cover the main results of this research. First, our
developed simulation environment is presented. Second, we examine the economic
sustainability of an integrated bidding strategy that manages a portfolio of
EVS. Here we compare the performance of the proposed control mechanism against
predefined benchmark strategies. Third, the RL approach that aims to optimize
the VPP portfolio is evaluated. In the last section, we show results of a
sensitivity analysis on the prediction accuracy, which proved to be a decisive
factor on the overall performance of the developed model.

** Simulation Environment
As part of this research, we developed an event-based simulation platform called
/FleetSim/. The platform allows researchers to develop and test out different
smart charging methods and bidding strategies in realistic environment based on
real-world data. In FleetSim, intelligent agents centrally control the charging
operation of an EV fleet and are responsible to meet the customer mobility
demand with sufficiently charged vehicles. At the same time, the agents can
create a VPP of EVs, provide balancing services to the grid, and take part in
electricity trading. Rental trips of the fleet are simulated on an individual
level. Charging decisions for individual EVs at a particular point in time have
consequences for the rest of the simulation. For example can an insufficiently
charged EV battery cause a ripple effect of lost rentals when the EV does not
get parked at a charging station again. The performance of the agents is
evaluated based on the saved charging costs of buying cheaper electricity on the
markets than charging with the regular industry tariff. Also, the opportunity
costs of losing rentals and the imbalances costs are considered.

FleetSim facilitates easy sensitivity analyses, adaption to future market
designs, and integration of novel data sets through its modular architecture and
expandable design (see Figure ref:fig-fleetsim). We consider FleetSim a research
platform for sustainable and smart mobility, similar to PowerTac
cite:ketter16_multiagent_comp_gaming. It builds on SimPy[fn:1], a process-based
discrete-event simulation framework. FleetSim is available open source[fn:2] and
can be readily installed as a Python package.

In order to simplify comparability and focus real-world applicability of the
analysis, we set the same parameters for all conducted experiments (see Table
ref:table-sim-params). They are corresponding to the real Car2Go specifications
described in Chapter ref:sec-data-car2go. We fixed the unknown prediction
accuracy of the fleets available charging power $\fPhat{}$ to an estimate of
modern forecast algorithms performance. The impact of the prediction uncertainty
on the results will later be determined in a sensitivity analysis.

** Integrated Bidding Strategy

Research question 1 examines whether a fleet operator can use a VPP portfolio of
EVs to profitably bid on multiple electricity markets simultaneously. In Chapter
ref:sec-model-mechanism, we proposed a central control mechanism that charges
the fleet with an integrated bidding strategy. The following section evaluates
the results of the controlled charging mechanism within the simulation
environment.

Table ref:table-sim-stats shows the descriptive statistics of the fleet
utilization during a simulation run, with data from June 1, 2016 to January
1, 2018. It can be observed that (a) the volatility of EVs parked at a charging
station is remarkably high (large standard deviation), and (b) the fraction of
EVs that can be utilized for VPP activities is comparatively low (3.55%). It is
apparent that a high uncertainty and the low share of EVs that can possibly
generate profits are challenging the economic sustainability of our proposed
model. Figure ref:fig-fleet-utilization shows that despite a changing rental
behavior throughout the day (e.g., rush hour peaks between 7:00-9:00 and
17:00-19:00), the amount of EVs that can utilized for VPP activities is
comparably stable throughout the day.

#+CAPTION[Fleet Utilzation]: Daily fleet utilization (average, standard deviation) from June 2016 to January 2018. The blue error band is illustrating the large volatility in the amount of EVs that get parked at a charging station. The share of EVs that can be used as a VPP is on average only 3.55% of the fleet's size. Most of the EVs are either not connected to a charging station or are already fully charged. label:fig-fleet-utilization

In order to evaluate the performance of the developed model, we defined several
"naive" bidding strategies that we benchmark against our model. The strategies
are naive in that sense that they are assuming a fixed risk associated with
bidding on a specific electricity market. As opposed to the developed RL agent,
they do not take information of their environment into account and do not adjust
the bidding quantities dynamically. Instead, the controller discounts the
predicted amount of available charging power with a fixed risk factor $\lambda$
(see eqref:eq-model-pb and eqref:eq-model-pi). Naturally, the controller
estimates a higher risk for bidding on the balancing market week ahead than on
the intraday market 30 minutes ahead. We defined the following types of
strategies:

 1) Risk-averse ($\lb{}\!=\!0.5$, $\li{}\!=\!0.3$)

    The controller avoids denying rentals and causing imbalances at all costs.
    In order to not commit more charging power that it can provide, it places
    only bids for conservative amounts of electricity on the markets. The
    risk-averse strategies /Balancing/ and /Intraday/ are comparable to similar
    strategies developed by
    textcite:kahlen17_fleet,kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem.

 2) Risk-seeking ($\lb{}\!=\!0.2$, $\li{}\!=\!0.0$)

    The controller aims to maximize its profits by trading as much electricity
    on the markets as possible. It strives to fully utilize the VPP and allocate
    a high percentage of available EVS to charge from the markets. Due to the
    rental uncertainty and a low estimated risk, the controller is prone to
    offering more charging power to the markets than it can provide. This may
    lead to lost rental costs or even imbalances.

 3) Full information

    The optimal strategy to solve the controlled charging problem. The controller
    knows the bidding risks in advance and places the perfect bids on the
    markets. In other words, it charges the maximal amount of electricity from
    the markets without having to deny rentals or causing imbalances due to
    prediction uncertainties.

In Table ref:table-profits, the simulation results of all tested strategies are
listed. As anticipated, the integrated bidding strategies outperform their
single market counterparts. With this novel bidding strategy, the controller is
able to capitalize on the most favorable market conditions and better utilize
the VPP by increasing the share of traded electricity to charge the fleet. The
integrated strategies are resulting in 49% - 54% more profits for the fleet than
the single market strategies and provide 31% - 61% more balancing power for the
grid.

A controller bidding according to the /Integrated (risk-averse)/ strategy, pays
approximately $0.35\ekwh$ less for charging the fleet than the regular industry
price, summing up to an profit increase of up to $67040\; \eur$ over the 1.5
year period. A controller bidding according to the /Integrated (risk-seeking)/
strategy, is even more profitable, despite having to account for lost rental
profits. On the other side, the controller caused imbalances (highlighted red)
which lead to high market penalties or even exclusion from bidding activities.
For this reason, imbalances need to be avoided, regardless of potential profits
from a higher VPP utilization. We expect that the proposed RL agent learns a
bidding strategy, which avoids imbalances while increasing profits at the same
time. In the next section we will explore this particular challenge and present
results of the RL algorithm.

** Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Optimization
# TODO: Include total annual profit increase per EV and total balancing power

Research question 2 investigates whether an RL agent can optimize the integrated
bidding strategy by dynamically adjusting the bidding quantities. The bidding
quantities $\Pb{}, \Pi{}$ are based on the evaluated risk associated with
bidding on the individual electricity markets. In Chapter ref:sec-model-rl, we
introduced an RL approach that learns the risk factors $\lb{}$, $\li{}$ based on
its observed environment and received reward signals. The hyperparameters which
we used to train the dueling DDQN algorithm and solving the controlled charging
problem under uncertainty are presented in Appendix ref:app-rl-hyperparams. The
values were determined manually through experimentation for the best results.
The speed of convergence was also used as a criterion, since the training
environment Google Colaboratory only allows up to 12 hours of computing time.

Furthermore, the imbalance costs $\beta$ were set to an artificially high value
to incentivize the agent to learn to always avoid imbalances. Whenever the
agents takes an action that causes imbalances, it will receive a highly negative
reward signal, leading to a low estimated Q-value of that chosen action in a
specific state.

#+CAPTION[Comparison of gross profit results]: Comparison of gross profits and traded electricity between the proposed optimized integrated strategy and the other three naive charging strategies. The RL algorithm increases the achieved gross profits of the integrated bidding strategy on average by 12% and accomplishes nearly optimal results when compared to the benchmark strategy. label:fig-rl-profits
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [ht]
[[../fig/rl-results.png]]

In Figure ref:fig-rl-profits, the performance of the optimized integrated
bidding strategy is presented. The proposed RL algorithm increases the gross
profits of the fleet on average (n=5) by approximately 72-75% when compared with
the naive single market strategies and by approximately 12% when compared with
the naive integrated strategy. To reach the optimal benchmark solution the gross
profits would only need to be increased by another 3%. The fleet provided a
total of 1461 MWh balancing power to the grid and thereby charged the EVs 25.3%
cheaper than the regular industry price. In summary, the RL agent managed to
optimize the VPP portfolio composition, increased the amount of traded
electricity and avoided imbalance at the same time.

In another experiment, we evaluated the performance of the proposed RL algorithm
in comparison to other RL algorithms with a simpler architecture. In particular,
we were interested what impact modern advances in deep RL have on the ability to
quickly learn to improve the agents policy, while still achieving good results
after the whole training period. This question is especially relevant for the
case, when no prior training for the fleet controller is possible and the agent
has to quickly learn to avoid procuring more energy from the markets that it can
charge. Therefore, we removed the notion of imbalance costs and changed the
simulation setup to instantly stop the training episode when imbalances occur.
In this way, the agents learns to maximize its reward while circumventing
imbalances at all costs. The agent achieves a higher reward the longer it trades
electricity on the markets without committing to charge more electricity than it
can. We compared the DQN algorithm
cite:mnih15_human_level_contr_throug_deep_reinf_learn with the Double DQN
algorithm cite:hasselt16_deep_reinf_learn_doubl_q_learn with and without the
dueling architecture cite:wang15_duelin_networ_archit_deep_reinf_learn.

# #+CAPTION[Learning Performance of RL Algorithms]: Comparison of the learning performance between the proposed RL algorithm and the other three simpler algorithms, averaged over 5 training attempts. Each training period is performed in 1.5 years of simulation time with real world data. The dueling DDQN algorithm (dark blue line) learns faster, and achieves better end-results than prior algorithms. label:fig-rl-learning
# #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [htb]
# [[../fig/rl-learning.png]]

# In Figure ref:fig-rl-learning the average learning performances of the different
# RL approaches are displayed. The experiment shows that the dueling DDQN
# algorithm learns the fastest and shows a large increase in mean reward per
# action after roughly 60 episodes of training, which equals about 227 days of
# simulation time. The dueling DDQN algorithm shows the largest reward increase
# and highest reward per action after the whole training period, which makes it
# the best algorithm to solve the charging problem. Despite that, it still has a
# larger mean absolute error than the DDQN algorithm, indicating that it is more
# likely to cause imbalances with the dueling architecture than without. None of
# the algorithms determined a policy that never caused imbalances after training
# on the full 1.5 years of simulation time, which is about one hour of computing
# time. In other words, without prior training on existing data the RL agent would
# need more than one and a half years to learn to avoid imbalances. A possible
# explanation is the problem of learning from long delayed rewards, first
# discussed by textcite:watkins89_learn_from_delay_rewar. Long delayed rewards
# increase the difficulty of RL problems, since the agent needs to connect
# occurring decision outcomes to specific actions way back in the past. In the
# case of the presented controlled fleet charging problem, this effect is
# especially pronounced because a negative reward signal, caused by imbalances,
# can occur up to 672 timesteps (one week) after the agent decided on the bidding
# quantity for the balancing market. In contrast, the reward signals from trading
# on the intraday market occur almost immediately after 2 timesteps (30 minutes).

In summary, both experiments show that our approach is able to learn a
profit-maximizing bidding strategy under varying circumstances, without using
any a priori information about the EV rental patterns. The proposed control
mechanism improves existing approaches and the RL agent can successfully
optimize the VPP portfolio strategy by estimating the risks that are associated
with bidding on the markets.

** Sensitivity Analysis
The ability to accurately forecast the available fleet charging power plays an
important role in determining the optimal bidding quantity to submit to the
markets. If the fleet controller is certain about the number of connected EVs
that it can use for VPP activities in the future, it can aggressively trade the
available charging power on the markets, without being concerned about turning
away customers or facing the risk of not being able to charge the committed
amount of electricity. In our previous experiments, we assumed a fixed
prediction accuracy that we set to an estimate of what modern mobility demand
forecasts algorithms can achieve. In order to test the robustness of the results
and their dependence on the prediction accuracy, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis. Therefore, we tested the previously introduced RL approach with
increasing levels of prediction accuracy, from 50% to 100% accurate forecasts, 7
days and 30 minutes ahead.

#+CAPTION[Sensivity Analysis of Prediction Accuracy]: Sensitivity analysis of the forecasting algorithms prediction accuracy. With increasing accuracy the estimated bidding risks decrease, while the realized gross profits grow considerably. label:fig-sens-accuracy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [htb]
[[../fig/rl-accuracy.png]]

Figure ref:fig-sens-accuracy depicts the results of the performed sensitivity
analysis. The left plot shows the effect of the prediction accuracy on the total
gross profit increase, whereas the right plot shows the effect on the learned
risk factors of the RL agent. Intuitively, the realized profit increases with
rising accuracy of the forecasts, while the estimated risk factors decrease with
more accurate forecasts. Interestingly, the RL agent does not always estimate
higher risks for bidding on the balancing market than on the intraday market,
despite lower accuracy levels for predicting the available charging power 7 days
ahead than 30 minutes ahead. This result indicates that the RL performance
underlies some variations, that could not be fully eliminated in the conducted
experiments. We hypothesize that the agent learns to avoid imbalances first and
only later learns to optimize the portfolio by fine-tuning the risk factors of
both markets. We are confident that the agent's limited amount of training steps
is the reason of these variations in the learning success and expect to achieve
more robust results with an increased training period.

Remarkable is the magnitude of the prediction accuracy's effect on the profit
increase (see Figure ref:fig-sens-accuracy, left plot). After 1.5 years of
simulation time, an RL agent that can rely on perfect predictions, with 100%
accuracy, generates almost twice as much profit from trading electricity than an
agent that can only rely on predictions with 50% and 60% accuracy, 7 days and 30
minutes ahead respectively. It is striking that the prediction accuracy has a
larger effect (99.13% profit increase between lowest and highest accuracy) on
the realized profit than the type of bidding strategy (73.10% profit increase
between worst and best strategy).
