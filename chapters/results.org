# NOTE: 15%

The following chapter will cover the main results of this research. First, the
simulation environment is presented. Second, we examine the economic
sustainability of an integrated bidding strategy. Third, the RL approach that
aims to optimize the VPP portfolio is evaluated. In the last section, we will
perform sensitivity analyses on the limiting algorithmic factor, the prediction
accuracy, and a limiting physical factor, the charging infrastructure.

** Simulation Environment
# NOTE: V2G?
As part of this research, we developed an event-based simulation platform called
/FleetSim/. The platform allows researchers to develop and test out different
smart charging and bidding strategies in realistic environment based on
real-world data. In FleetSim, intelligent agents (called controllers) centrally
control the charging of an EV fleet, they are responsible to sufficiently charge
their vehicles to satisfy real mobility demand. At the same time, the agents can
create VPP of EVs, provide balancing services to the grid, and take part in
electricity trading. Trips are simulated on an individual level, for example,
not charging an individual EV at a particular point in time, can cause a whole
series of lost rentals, due to an insufficient amount of battery for the next
arriving customers. The agents are evaluated based on the profits of charging
the fleet cheaper than the industry tariff, the costs of losing rentals and the
imbalance they cause if they can not provide market commitments. Additionally,
FleetSim facilitates easy sensitivity analyses, adaption to future market
designs, and integration of novel data sets through its modular architecture and
expandable design (see Figure ref:fig-fleetsim). We consider FleetSim as a
research platform for sustainable and smart mobility similar to PowerTac
cite:ketter16_multiagent_comp_gaming. It builds on SimPy[fn:1], a process-based
discrete-event simulation framework. FleetSim is available open source[fn:2] and
can be readily installed as a Python package.

In order to simplify comparability and focus to real-world applicability of the
analysis, we set the same parameters for all conducted experiments (see Table
ref:table-sim-params). They are corresponding to the real Car2Go specifications
described in Chapter ref:sec-data-car2go. Further, we fixed the unknown
prediction accuracy of the fleets available charging power $\fPhat{}$ to an
estimate of modern forecast algorithms performance. The impact of the
predictions uncertainty on the results will later be determined in a sensitivity
analysis.

** Integrated Bidding Strategy
# NOTE: Additional bar-plot with monthly increasing profits?
Research Question 1 examines whether a fleet operator can use a VPP portfolio of
EVs to profitably bid on multiple electricity markets. In Chapter
ref:sec-model-mechanism, we proposed a central control mechanism that charges
the fleet with an integrated bidding strategy. The following section evaluates
the results of the control mechanism in the simulation environment.

Table ref:table-sim-stats shows the descriptive statistics of the fleet
utilization during a simulation run, with data from June 1, 2016 to January
1, 2018. It can be observed that (a) the volatility of EVs parked at a charging
station is remarkably high (large standard deviation), and (b) the fraction of
EVs that can be utilized for VPP activities is diminishing low (3.55%). It is
apparent that a high uncertainty and the low share of EVs that can possibly
generate profits are challenging the economic sustainability of our proposed
model. Figure ref:fig-fleet-utilization shows that despite a changing rental
behavior throughout the day (e.g., rush hour peaks between 7:00-9:00 and
17:00-19:00), the amount of EVs that can utilized for VPP activities is
comparably stable throughout the day.

The blue error band is illustrating the large volatility in the amount of EVs that get parked at a charging station. The share of EVs that can be used as VPP is on average only 3.55% of the fleet's size. Most of the EVs are either not connected to a charging station or are already fully charged. label:fig-fleet-utilization

We defined several "naive" bidding strategies to evaluate and benchmark the
performance of our developed model. The strategies are naive in that sense that
they are assuming a fixed risk associated with bidding at a specific electricity
market. As opposed to the developed RL agent, they do not take information of
their environment into account and adjust the bidding quantities dynamically.
Instead, the controller discounts the predicted amount of available charging
power with a fixed risk factor $\lambda$ (see \eqref{eq-model-pb} and
\eqref{eq-model-pi}). Naturally, the controller estimates a higher risk for
bidding on the balancing market week ahead than on the intraday market 30
minutes ahead. We defined following types of strategies:
1) Risk-averse ($\lb{}\!=\!0.5$, $\li{}\!=\!0.3$)

   The controller avoids denying rentals and causing imbalances at all costs. In
   order to not commit more charging power that it can provide, it places only
   bids for conservative amounts of electricity on the markets. The risk-averse
   strategies /Balancing/ and /Intraday/ are comparable to similar strategies
   developed by
   textcite:kahlen17_fleet,kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem.

2) Risk-seeking ($\lb{}\!=\!0.2$, $\li{}\!=\!0.0$)

   The controller aims to maximize its profits by trading as much electricity on
   the markets as possible. It strives to fully utilize the VPP and allocate a
   high percentage of available EVS to charge from the markets. Due to the
   rental uncertainty and a low estimated risk, the controller is prone to
   offering more charging power to the markets that it can provide. This may
   lead to lost rental costs or even imbalances.

3) Full information

   The optimal strategy to solve the controlled charging problem. The controller
   knows the bidding risks in advance and places the perfect bids on the
   markets. In other words, it charges the maximal amount of electricity from
   the markets without having to deny rentals or causing imbalances due to
   prediction uncertainties.

# NOTE: Mention numbers?
In Table ref:table-profits, the simulation results of all tested strategies are
listed. As expected, the developed integrated bidding strategies outperform
their single market counterparts. The controller is able to capitalize on the
most favorable market conditions and better utilizes the VPP by buying more
electricity from the markets than charging the EVs regularly. The integrated
strategies are resulting in 49%-54% more profits for the fleet than the single
market strategies and provide 31%-61% more balancing power for the grid.

A controller bidding according to the /Integrated (risk-averse)/ strategy, pays
approximatly $0.35\ekwh$ less for charging the fleet than the regular industry
price, summing up to an profit increase of up to $67040\; \eur$ over the 1.5
year period. A controller bidding according to th /Integrated (risk-seeking)/
strategy, is even more profitable, despite having to account for lost rental
profits. On the other side, the controller caused imbalances (highlighted red)
which lead to high (unknown) market penalties or even exclusion from bidding
activities. For this reason, imbalances need to be avoided, regardless of
potential profits from a higher VPP utilization. We expect that the proposed RL
agent learns a bidding strategy, which avoids imbalances while increasing
profits at the same time. The best possible solution, given the prediction
uncertainty, is given by the strategy /Integrated (full information)/.

Research Question 2 investigates whether a RL agent can optimize the integrated
bidding strategy by dynamically adjusting the bidding quantities. The bidding
quantities $\Pb{}, \Pi{}$ are based on the evaluated risk associated with
bidding on the individual electricity markets. In Chapter ref:sec-model-rl, we
introduced a RL approach that learns the risk factors $\lb{}$, $\li{}$ based on
its observed environment and received reward signals. In Appendix
ref:app-rl-hyperparams, the hyperparameters are presented which we used to train
the dueling DDQN algorithm and solving the controlled charging problem under
uncertainty. The values were determined manually through experimentation for the
best results. The speed of convergence was also used as a criterion, since the
training environment Google Colaboratory only allows up to 12 hours of computing
time.

Further, the imbalance costs $\beta$ were set to an artificially high value to
incentivize the agent to learn to always avoid imbalances. Whenever the agents
takes an action that causes imbalances (i.e., bid too much electricity), it will
receive a highly negative reward signal, leading to a low estimated Q-value of
that chosen action in a specific state.

#+CAPTION[Comparison of gross profit results]: Comparison of gross profits and traded electricity between the proposed optimized integrated strategy and the other three naive charging strategies. The RL algorithm improves the achieved gross profit increase of the integrated bidding strategy on average by 12% and accomplishes nearly optimal results when compared to the benchmark strategy. label:fig-rl-profits
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [h]
[[../fig/rl-results.png]]

In Figure ref:fig-rl-profits, the performance of the optimized integrated
bidding strategy is presented. The proposed RL algorithm increases the gross
profits of the fleet on average (n=5) by approximately 72-75% when compared with
the naive single market strategies and by approximately 12% when compared with
the naive integrated strategy. To reach the optimal benchmark solution the gross
profits would only need to be increased by another 3%. The fleet provided a
total of 1461 MWh balancing power to the grid and therby charged its EVs 25.3%
cheaper than the regular industry price. In summary, the RL agent managed to
optimize the VPP portfolio composition, increased the amount of traded
electricity and avoided imbalance at the same time.

In another experiment, we evaluated the performance of the proposed RL algorithm
in comparison to other RL algorithms with a simpler architecture. In particular,
we were interested what impact modern advances in deep RL have on the ability to
quickly learn to improve the agents policy, while still achieving good results
after the whole training period. This question is especially relevant for the
case, when no prior training for the fleet controller is possible and the agent
has to quickly learn to avoid procuring more energy from the markets that it can
charge. Therefore, we removed the notion of imbalance costs and changed the
simulation setup to instantly stop the training episode when imbalances occur.
In this way, the agents learns to maximize its reward while circumventing
imbalances at all costs. The agent achieves a higher reward the longer it trades
electricity on the markets without committing to charge more electricity than it
can. We compared the DQN algorithm
cite:mnih15_human_level_contr_throug_deep_reinf_learn with the Double DQN
algorithm cite:hasselt16_deep_reinf_learn_doubl_q_learn with and without the
dueling architecture cite:wang15_duelin_networ_archit_deep_reinf_learn. In
Figure ref:fig-rl-learning, the average (n=5) learning performances of the
different RL approaches are displayed.

#+CAPTION[Comparison of RL algorithm learning performance]: Comparison of the learning performance between the proposed RL algorithm and the other three simpler algorithms, averaged over 5 training attempts. Each training period is performed in 1.5 years simulation time with real world data. The dueling DDQN algorithm (dark blue line) learns faster, and achieves better end results than prior algorithms. label:fig-rl-learning
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [h]
[[../fig/rl-learning.png]]

The experiment shows that the dueling DDQN algorithm learns the fastest and
shows a large increase in mean reward per action after roughly 60 episodes
(about 227 days of simulation time) of training. The dueling DDQN algorithm
shows the largest reward increase and highest reward per action after the whole
training period, which makes it the best algorithm to solve the charging
problem. Despite that it still has a larger mean absolute error than the DDQN
algorithm, indicating that it is more likely to cause imbalances with the
dueling architecture than without. None of the algorithms determined a policy
that never caused imbalances after training on the full 1.5 years of simulation
time (about one hour computing time). In other words, without prior training
with existing data the RL agent would need more than one and a half years to
learn to avoid imbalances. A possible explanation is the problem of learning
from long delayed rewards, first discussed by
textcite:watkins89_learn_from_delay_rewar. Long delayed rewards increase the
difficulty of RL problems, since the agent needs to connect occurring decision
outcomes to specific actions way back in the past. In the case of the presented
controlled fleet charging problem, this effect is especially pronounced because
a negative reward signal (caused imbalances) can occur up to 672 timesteps (one
week) after the agent decided on the bidding quantity for the balancing market,
whereas the reward signals from the intraday market occur almost immediately
after 2 timesteps (30 minutes).

In summary, both experiments show that our approach is able to learn a
profit-maximizing bidding strategy under varying circumstances, without using
any a priori information about the EV rental patterns. The proposed control
mechanism improves existing approaches and the RL agent can successfully
optimize the VPP portfolio strategy by estimating the risk that is associated
with bidding on the markets.

** Sensitivity Analysis
# NOTE: Prediction Accuracy of available EV capacity
# NOTE: Balancing accuracy always lower than intraday! Otherwise no sense
# NOTE: Do predict electricity prices?

# NOTE: Results heavily dependent on industry charging price, since on average
# the balancing prices are 50% cheaper, and intraday 30% cheaper. Perform a run?

The ability to accurately forecast the available fleet charging power plays an
important role in determining the optimal bidding quantity to submit to the
markets. If the fleet controller is certain about the number of connected EVs
that it can use for VPP activities in the future, it can aggressively trade the
available charging power on the markets, without being concerned about turning
away customers or facing the risk of not being able to charge the committed
amount of electricity. In our previous experiments, we assumed a fixed
prediction accuracy that we set to an estimate of what modern mobility demand
forecasts algorithms can achieve. In order to test the robustness of the results
and their dependence on the prediction accuracy, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis. Therefore, we tested the previously introduced RL approach with
increasing levels of predecition accuracy, from 50% to 100% accuracate forecasts
7 days and 30 minutes ahead.

#+CAPTION[Sensivity Analysis: Prediction Accuracy]: Sensivity Analysis: Prediction Accuracy label:fig-sens-accuracy
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth :placement [htbp]
[[../fig/rl-accuracy.png]]

In Table ref:fig-sens-accuracy the results of the sensitivity analysis are
presented. The left plot shows the effect of the prediction accuracy on the
total gross profit increase, whereas the right plot shows the effect on the
learned risk factors of the RL agent. Intuitively, the realized profit increases
with rising accuracy of the forecasts, while the estimated risk factors decrease
with more accurate forecasts.

Interestingly, the RL agent does not always estimate higher risks for bidding on
the balancing market than on the intraday market,  despite lower accuracy levels
for predicting the available charging power 7 days ahead than 30 minutes ahead.
This result indicates that the RL performance underlies some variations. The
agent succesfully learns to avoid imbalances first by estimating a high total
risk and only later learns to optimize the portfolio by fine-tuning the risk
factors of both markets. We are confident that the agent's limited amount of
training steps is the reason of these variations in learning success and expect
to achieve more robust results with a increased training time.

Also remarkable is the magnitude of the prediction accuracy's effect on the
profit increase. After 1.5 years of simulation time, a RL agent that can rely on
perfect predictions (100% accuracy) generates almost twice as much profit from
trading electricity than an agent that can only rely on predictions with 50% and
60% accuracy, 7 days and 30 minutes ahead respectively. It is striking that the
prediction accuracy has a larger effect (99.13% profit increase between lowest
and highst accuracy) on the realized profit than the type of bidding strategy
(73.10% profit increase between worst and best strategy), which we examined in
the previous sections, leaving room for future research.
