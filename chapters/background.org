* Background
The following chapter describes the relevant research and the theoretical
background of this thesis. First, we introduce smart electricity markets, give
detailed explanations of two particular types of electricity markets,  and
explain applications for EV fleets in the smart grid. Next, we discuss the
related RL literature in the context of controlled EV charging. Finally, the
methodological background is presented in the form of a comprehensive review of
the most important concepts and formulations in RL theory.

** Smart Electricity Markets
On electricity markets, participants place asks (sale offers) and bids (purchase
orders) in auctions to match the supply of electricity generation and the demand
for electricity consumption. The electricity price is determined by an auction
mechanism, which can take different forms depending on the type of market.
Germany, like many other western countries, has a liberalized energy system in
which the generation and distribution of electricity are decoupled. Multiple
electricity markets exist in a liberalized energy system. They differ in the
auction design and in their reaction time between the order contract and the
delivery of electricity. Day-ahead markets and spot markets have a reaction time
between a day and several hours, whereas in operating reserve markets the
reaction time ranges from minutes to seconds. Most electricity markets work
according to the merit order principle in which resources are considered in
ascending order of the energy price until the capacity demand is met. The
clearing price is determined by the energy price, at the point where supply
meets demand. Payment models differ in the markets: In contrast to day-ahead
markets, where a uniform pricing schema is applied, in secondary reserve markets
and intraday markets, participants get compensated by the price they bid (pay-as-bid
principle).

In smart electricity markets, EV fleet operators can offer the capacity of their
EV batteries to different types of markets. On operating reserve markets, prices
are usually more volatile and consequently more attractive for VPPs
cite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor. But operating reserve
markets also bear a higher risk for the fleet: Commitments have to be made up to
one week in advance when customer demands are still uncertain. In order to avoid
penalties for unfulfilled commitments only a conservative amount of capacity can
be offered to the market. On the other hand, spot markets allow participants to
continuously trade electricity products up to five minutes prior to delivery.
Just minutes before delivery it is possible to predict the available battery
capacity of the fleet with a high accuracy. This certainty creates the possibility
to aggressively trade the available battery capacity with a low risk at the spot
market.
** Electricity Market Theory
In the following chapter, we will explain the market design, market properties
and bidding procedures of the balancing market and spot market in more detail,
as they are the markets we include in our research.

*** Balancing Market label:sec-balancing-market
The balancing market is a tool to balance frequency deviations in the power
grid. It offers auctions for primary control reserve, secondary control reserve
as well as tertiary control reserve (minute reserve), which primarily differ in
the required ramp-up times of the participants.
As depicted in Figure ref:fig-electricity-markets, the balancing market is
conceptually placed at the intersection between the open electricity markets and
the physical power system cite:veen16_elect_balan_market. It can be seen as the
last link in a chain of electricity markets, although the lead time of capacity
allocation is considerably longer than the at day-ahead or intraday markets.

In this study, we will look at the German control reserve market (GCRM), one of
the largest frequency regulation markets in the world. However, the presented
concepts can be easily transferred to other balancing markets in liberalized
energy systems, since the market design is similar
cite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ. Transmission systems
operators (TSO) procure their required control reserve via tender auctions at
the GCRM. The market conducts daily auctions for the three types of control
reserve. This thesis focuses on the secondary operating reserve auction, in
which participants must be able to supply or absorb a minimum of 1 MW of power
over a 4-hour interval within a reaction time of 30 seconds.[fn:1] Since EV
batteries can absorb energy almost instantly when they are connected to a
charging station, they are suitable to provide such balancing services that
require fast ramp-up times. Operating reserve providers have to be qualified by
the TSO to participate in the market and prove that they are able to reliably
provide balancing power. Although EV fleets are currently not qualified by the
GCRM to be used as operating reserve, they could theoretically handle the
minimum capacity requirements if they are large enough. Around 220 EVs would
need to simultaneously charge at standard 4.6 kW charging stations to provide 1
MW of downward regulating capacity.

Up until 28^{th} July 2018, auctions were held weekly, with two different
segments each week (peak hours/non-peak hours). Afterwards, the auction
mechanism changed to daily auctions of six four-hour segments of positive and
negative control reserve.[fn:2] Shorter auction cycles facilitate the
integration of renewable energy generators into the secondary control reserve
market, as they are dependent on accurate (short-term) capacity forecasts.
Positive control reserve is energy that is supplied to the grid, when the grid
frequency falls below 50 Hz. It can be provided by increasing the electricity
generation or by reducing the grid load (i.e., electricity consumption). On the
contrary, negative control reserve is required when the grid frequency rises
above 50 Hz and can be provided by adding grid load or reducing electricity
generation. Since we do not consider V2G in this thesis (see next chapter), the
EV fleets in our model are only able provide negative control reserve, which
we will plainly refer to as /balancing power/ until the end of the thesis.

Market participants submit bids in the form $(\Pb{}, \cp{}, \ep{})$ to the
market, where $\Pb{}$ is the amount of electrical power that can be supplied on
demand in kW, $\cp{}$ is the capacity price for keeping the power available in
$\emw$ and $\ep{}$ is the energy price for delivered energy in $\emwh$. The TSOs
determine the target quantity of balancing power to acquire per market period
based on historical balancing data. They usually acquire much higher regulation
capacity to minimize risks and activate the needed amount of capacity on demand.
The TSOs accept the bids based on the capacity price in a merit order. Providers
whose bids were accepted instantly get compensated for the provided capacity
$\Pb{}$. At the time regulation capacity is needed, usually a day to a week
later, the TSO activates the capacity according to a merit order of the
ascending energy prices $\ep{}$. Hence, providers are also compensated according
to the actual energy $\Eb{}$ they supplied or consumed. Since providers get paid
according to the submitted prices $\cp{}$ and $\ep{}$ (instead of a market
clearing price) this type of auction is called /pay-as-bid/ auction.
*** Spot Market label:sec-spot-market
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the equilibrium of electricity supply and
demand is ensured through a sequence of interdependent wholesale markets
cite:pape16_are_fundam_enoug. Next to the balancing market at the end of the
sequence, mainly two different types of spot markets exist, the day-ahead market
and the intraday market. In this research, we consider the European Power
Exchange (EPEX Spot) as it is the largest electricity market in Europe, with a
total trading volume of approximately 567 TWh in 2018[fn:3], but most
spot markets in western economies work with similar market mechanisms.

Germany's most important spot market is the day-ahead market with a
trading volume of over 234 TWh in 2018[fn:3]. Participants place asks and bids
for hourly contracts of the following day on the /EPEX Spot Day-ahead Auction/
market until the market closes at 12pm on the day before delivery (see Figure
ref:fig-electricity-markets). The day-ahead market plays an important role in
integrating volatile renewable energy sources (RES) into the power system
cite:pape16_are_fundam_enoug. Generators forecast the expected generation
capacity for the next day and sell those quantities on the market
cite:karanfil17_role_contin_intrad_elect_market. After the market closes, the
participants have the opportunity to trade the difference between the day-ahead
forecast and the more precise intraday forecast (forecasting error) on the
intraday market cite:kiesel17_econom_analy_intrad_elect_prices. In this way, RES
generators can cost effectively self-balance their portfolios, instead of
relying on balancing services provided by the TSO, which imposes high imbalance
costs on participants cite:pape16_are_fundam_enoug.

On the /EPEX Spot Intraday Continuous/ market, electricity products are traded
up until 5 minutes before physical delivery. Hourly contracts, as well as
15-minute and block contracts, can be traded. In contrast to the day-ahead
auction, the intraday market is a continuous order-driven market. Participants
can submit limit orders at any time during the trading window and equally change
or withdraw the order at any time before the order is accepted. Limit orders are
specified as price-quantity pairs $(\Pi{}, \up{})$, where $\Pi{}$ is the traded
amount of electrical power in kW and $\up{}$ is the price for the delivered
energy unit (hour/quarter/block) in $\emwh$. When an order to buy (bid) matches
an order to sell (ask), the trade gets executed immediately. The order book is
visible to all participants, it is known which unmatched orders exist at the
time of interest. The intraday market has a trading volume of 82 TWh, which is
considerably smaller than the day-ahead market's volume. Despite that, the
intraday market plays a vital role to the stability of the grid. All executed
trades on the intraday market potentially reduce the needed balancing power of
the TSOs and thus can be seen as a type of balancing power
cite:pape16_are_fundam_enoug.

Purchasing electricity on the continuous intraday market is attractive for EV
fleets with uncertain mobility demand. The short time before delivery allows EV
fleet operators to rely on highly accurate forecasts of available battery
capacity, before submitting an order to buy. In this way, they can reliably
charge at a potentially lower price at the intraday market than the regular
industry tariff. In an integrated bidding strategy, EV fleet operators can
(similarly to RES generators) balance out forecast errors of available battery
capacity on the intraday market. For example can trades on the intraday market
complement bids that have been committed earlier to the balancing market.
** EV Fleet Control in the Smart Grid
The increasing penetration of EVs has a substantial effect on electricity
consumption patterns. During charging periods, power flows and grid losses
increase considerably and challenge the grid. Operators have to reinforce the
grid to ensure that transformers and substations do not overload
cite:sioshansi12_impac_elect_tarif_plug_in,lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system.
Charging multiple EVs in the same neighborhood, or worse, whole EV fleets, can
even cause brown- or blackouts cite:kim12_carbit. Despite these challenges, it
is possible to support the physical reinforcement of the grid by adopting smart
charging strategies. In smart charging, EVs get charged when the grid is less
congested to ensure grid stability. Smart charging reduces peaks in electricity
demand (/peak cutting/) and complement the grid in times of low demand (/valley
filling/). Smart charging has been researched thoroughly in the IS literature,
in the following we will outline some of the most important contributions.


# NOTE: Section Smart charging examples and studies
textcite:valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag found that using
intelligent agents to schedule EV charging substantially reshapes the energy
demand and reduces peak demand without violating individual household
preferences. Moreover, they showed that the proposed smart charging behavior
reduces average energy prices and thus benefit households economically. In
another study, textcite:kara15_estim_benef_elect_vehic_smart investigated the
effect of smart charging on public charging stations in California. Controlling
for arrival and departure times, the authors presented beneficial results for
the distribution system operator and the owners of the EVs. Their approach
resulted in a price reduction in energy bills and a peak load reduction of 37%.
An extension of the smart charging concept is V2G. When equipped with V2G
devices, EVs can discharge their batteries back into the grid. Existing research
has focused on this technology in respect to grid stabilization effects and
arbitrage possibilities. For instance,
textcite:schill11_elect_vehic_imper_elect_market showed that the V2G usage of
EVs can decrease average consumer electricity prices. Excess EV battery capacity
can be used to charge in off-peak hours and discharge in peak hours, when the
prices are higher. These arbitrage possibilities reverse welfare effects of
generators and increase the overall welfare and consumer surplus.
textcite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor found that the
arbitrage opportunities are especially prominent when a high variability in
electricity prices on the target electricity market exists. The authors stated
that short intervals between the contract of sale and the physical delivery of
electricity increase arbitrage benefits. Consequently, ancillary service
markets, like frequency control and operating reserve markets, are attractive
for smart charging.

# NOTE: Section Explain and prove why leaving out V2G.
# NOTE: Kahlen and Brand both balancing market, Brand never used V2G
textcite:peterson10_econom_using_plug_in_hybrid investigated energy arbitrage
profitability with V2G in the light of battery depreciation effects in the US.
The results of their study indicate that the large-scale use of EV batteries for
grid storage does not yield enough monetary benefits to incentivize EV owners to
participate in V2G activities. Considering battery depreciation cost, the
authors arrived at an annual profit of only 6\dollar -- 72\dollar per EV.
textcite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ evaluated a business
model for parking garage operators operating on the German frequency regulation
market. When taking infrastructure costs and battery depreciation costs into
account, they conclude that the proposed vehicle-grid integration is not
profitable. Even with idealized assumptions about EV adoption rates in Germany
and altered auction mechanisms, the authors arrived at negative profits.
textcite:kahlen17_fleet used EV fleets to offer balancing services to the grid.
Evaluating the impact of V2G in their model, the authors conclude that V2G would
only be profitable if reserve power prices were twice as high. Considering the
negative results from the studies mentioned above, we did not include the
V2G concept in our research.

# NOTE: Section Trading strategies on multiple markets, battery depreciation
In order to maximize profits, it is essential for market participants to develop
successful bidding strategies. Several authors have investigated bidding
strategies to jointly participate in multiple markets:
textcite:mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2 used stationary battery
storage to participate in the spinning reserve market and the day-ahead market
at the same time. The authors developed a non-equilibrium model, which solves
the presented mixed-integer program with genetic programming. Contrarily to
their study, we investigate the use of a model-free RL agent that learns an
optimal policy (i.e., a trading strategy) from actions it takes in the
environment (i.e., bidding on electricity markets).
textcite:he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag conducted similar research, in
which they additionally incorporated battery depreciation costs in a profit
maximization model, which proved to be a decisive factor. In contrast their
study, we jointly participate in the secondary operating reserve and intraday
market with the /non-stationary/ storage of EV batteries. Also, we can exclude
battery depreciation from our model, since shared EVs have to satisfy mobility
demand and be charged in any case.

# NOTE: Section Intelligent Agents within Smart Charging and VPPs
Previous studies often assume that car owners or households can directly trade
on electricity markets. In reality, this is not possible due to the minimum
capacity requirements of the markets, requirements that single EVs do not meet.
For example, the German Control Reserve Market (GCRM) has a minimum trading
capacity of 1 MW to 5 MW, while a typical EV has a charging power of 3.6 kW to
22 kW. textcite:ketter13_power_tac introduced the notion of electricity brokers,
aggregators that act on behalf of a group of individuals or households to
participate in electricity markets.
textcite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ and
textcite:kahlen14_balan_with_elect_vehic showed that electricity brokers can
overcome the capacity issues by aggregating EV batteries. In addition to
electricity brokers, we apply the concept of VPPs. VPPs are flexible portfolios
of distributed energy resources, which are presented with a single load profile
to the system operator, making them eligible for market participation and
ancillary service provisioning
cite:pudjianto07_virtual_power_plant_system_integ. Hence, VPPs allow providing
balancing power to the markets without knowing which exact sources provide the
promised capacity until the delivery time. This concept is specially useful when
dealing with EV fleets: VPPs enable carsharing providers to issue bids and asks
based on an estimate of available fleet capacity, without knowing beforehand
which exact EVs will provide the capacity at the time of delivery. Based on the
battery level and the availability of EVs, an intelligent agent decides in
real-time which vehicles provide the capacity.

# NOTE: Section Carsharing and EV fleets
Centrally managed EV fleets make it possible for carsharing providers to use the
presented concepts as a viable business extension. Free float carsharing is a
popular mobility concept that allows cars to be picked up and parked everywhere,
and the customers are billed is by the minute. This concept offers flexibility
to its users, saves resources, and reduces carbon emissions
cite:firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities. Most previous studies
concerned with the usage of EVs for electricity trading, assumed that trips are
fixed and known in advance, e.g., in
textcite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor. The free float
concept adds uncertainty and nondeterministic behavior, which make predictions
about future rentals a complex issue. textcite:kahlen17_fleet showed that it is
possible to use free float carsharing fleets as VPPs to profitably offer
balancing services to the grid. In their study, the authors compared cases from
three different cities across Europe and the US. They used an event-based
simulation, bootstrapped with real-world carsharing and secondary operating
reserve market data from the respective cities. A central dilemma within their
research was to decide whether an EV should be committed to a VPP or free for
rent. Since rental profits are considerably higher than profits from electricity
trading, it is crucial to not allocate an EV to a VPP when it could have been
rented out otherwise. To deal with the asymmetric payoff,
citeauthor:kahlen17_fleet used stratified sampling in their classifier. This
method gives rental misclassifications higher weights, reducing the likelihood
of EVs to participate in VPP activities. The authors used a random forest
regression model to predict the available balancing capacity on an aggregated
fleet level. Only at the delivery time, the agent decides which individual EVs
provide the regulation capacity. This heuristic is based on the likelihood that
the vehicle is rented out and on its expected rental benefits.

In a similar study, the authors showed that carsharing companies can participate
in day-ahead markets for arbitrage purposes
cite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem. In the paper, the authors
used a sinusoidal time-series model to predict the available trading capacity.
Another central problem for carsharing providers is that committed trades, which
can not be fulfilled, result in substantial penalties from the system operator
or electricity exchange. In other words, fleet operators have to avoid buying
any amount of electricity, which they can not be sure to charge with their
available EVs at the delivery time. To address this issue, the authors developed
a mean asymmetric weighted objective function. They used it for their
time-series based prediction model to penalize committing an EV to VPP when it
would have been rented out otherwise. Because of the two issues mentioned above,
textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem could only make very
conservative estimations and commitments of overall available trading capacity,
resulting in a high amount of missed profits. This effect is especially
prominent when participating in the secondary operating reserve market, since
commitments have to be made one week in advance when mobility demands are still
uncertain. textcite:kahlen17_fleet stated that in 42% to 80% of the cases, EVs
are not committed to a VPP when it would have been profitable to do so.

This thesis proposes a solution in which the EV fleet participates in the
balancing market and intraday market simultaneously. With this approach, we
align the potentially higher profits on the balancing markets, with more
accurate capacity predictions for intraday markets
cite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor. This research followed
textcite:kahlen17_fleet, who proposed to work on a combination of multiple
markets in the future.

** Reinforcement Learning Controlled EV Charging label:ref-back-rl

Previous research showed that intelligent agents equipped with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) methods can successfully take action in the smart grid. The
following chapter outlines different research approaches of RL in the domain of
smart grids. For a more thorough description, mathematical formulations and
common issues, of RL refer to Chapter ref:sec-reinforcement-learning.

textcite:reddy11_learn_behav_multip_auton_agent,reddy11_strat used autonomous
broker agents to buy and sell electricity from DER on a proposed /Tariff
Market/. The agents are modelled with a Markov decision process (MDP) and use RL
to determine pricing strategies to profitably participate in the Tariff Market.
To control for a large number of possible states in the domain, the authors used
/Q-Learning/ with derived state space features. Based on descriptive statistics,
they defined derived price and market participant features. By engaging with its
environment, the agent learns an optional sequence of actions (policy) based on
the state of the agent.

textcite:peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton built on that work and further
enhanced the method by using function approximation. Function approximation
allows to efficiently learn strategies over large state spaces, by learning a
function representation of state values instead of learning single values of
discrete states. By using this technique, the agent can adapt to arbitrary
economic signals from its environment, resulting in better performance than
previous approaches. Moreover, the authors applied feature selection and
regularization methods to explore the agent's adaption to the environment. These
methods are particularly beneficial in smart markets because market design,
structures, and conditions might change in the future. Hence, intelligent agents
should be able to adapt to it cite:peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton.

textcite:vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet facilitated learned EV fleet
charging behavior to optimally purchase electricity on the day-ahead market.
Similarly to textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem, the
problem is framed from the viewpoint of an aggregator that tries to define a
cost-effective day-ahead charging plan in the absence of knowing EV charging
parameters, such as departure time. A crucial point of the study is weighting
low charging prices against costs that have to be paid when an excessive or
insufficient amount of electricity is bought from the market (imbalance costs).
Contrarily, textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem did not
consider imbalance cost in their model and avoid them by sacrificing customer
mobility in order to balance the market (i.e., not showing the EV available for
rent, when it is providing balancing capacity).
textcite:vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet used a /fitted Q Iteration/ to
control for continuous variables in their state and action space. In order to
achieve fast convergence, they additionally optimized the /temperature step/
parameter of the Boltzmann exploration probability.

textcite:dusparic13_multi proposed a multi-agent approach for residential demand
response. The authors investigated a setting in which nine EVs were connected to
the same transformer. The RL agents learned to charge at minimal costs, without
overloading the transformer. textcite:dusparic13_multi utilized /W-Learning/ to
simultaneously learn multiple policies (i.e., objectives such as ensuring
minimum battery charged or ensuring charging at low costs).
textcite:taylor14_accel_learn_trans_learn extended this research by employing
Transfer Learning and /Distributed W-Learning/ to achieve communication between
the learning processes of the agents in a multi-objective, multi-agent setting.
textcite:dauer13_market_based_ev_charg_coord proposed a market-based EV fleet
charging solution. The authors introduced a double-auction call market where
agents trade the available transformer capacity, complying with the minimum
required State of Charge (SoC). The participating EV agents autonomously learn
their bidding strategy with standard /Q-Learning/ and discrete state and action
spaces.

textcite:di13_elect_vehic presented a multi-agent solution to minimize charging
costs of EVs, a solution that requires neither prior knowledge of electricity
prices nor future price predictions. Similar to
textcite:dauer13_market_based_ev_charg_coord, the authors employed standard
/Q-Learning/ and the \epsilon-greedy approach for action selection.
textcite:vaya14_optim also proposed a multi-agent approach, in which the
individual EVs are agents that actively place bids in the spot market. Again,
the agents use /Q-Learning/, with an \epsilon-greedy policy to learn their
optimal bidding strategy. The latter relies on the agents willingness-to-pay
which depends on the urgency to charge. State variables, such as SoC, time of
departure and price development on the market, determine the urgency to charge.
The authors compared this approach with a centralized aggregator-based approach
that they developed in another paper cite:vaya15_optim_biddin_strat_plug_in.
Compared to the centralized approach, in which the aggregator manages charging
and places bids for the whole fleet, the multi-agent approach causes slightly
higher costs but solves scalability and privacy problems.

textcite:shi11_real consider a V2G control problem, while assuming real-time
pricing. The authors proposed an online learning algorithm which they modeled as
a discrete-time MDP and solved through /Q-Learning/. The algorithm controls the
V2G actions of the EV and can react to real-time price signals of the market. In
this single-agent approach, the action space compromises only charging,
discharging and regulation actions. The limited action spaces makes it
relatively easy to learn an optimal policy.
textcite:chis16_reinf_learn_based_plug_in looked at reducing the costs of
charging for a single EV using known day-ahead prices and predicted next-day
prices. A Bayesian ANN was employed for prediction and /fitted Q-Learning/ was
used to learn daily charging levels. In their research, the authors used
function approximation and batch reinforcement learning, an offline, model-free
learning method. textcite:ko18_mobil_aware_vehic_to_grid proposed a centralized
controller for managing V2G activities in multiple microgrids. The proposed
method considers mobility and electricity demands of autonomous microgrids, as
well as SoC of the EVs. The authors formulated an MDP with discrete state and
action spaces and use standard /Q-Learning/ with \epsilon-greedy policy to
derive an optimal charging policy.

It should be noted that RL methods are not the only solution for problems in the
smart grid, often basic algorithms and heuristics provide satisfactory results
cite:vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon. Another possibility are
stochastic programming approaches, which rigorously model the problem as an
optimization problem under uncertainty that can be analytically solved, for
example textcite:pandzic13_offer_model_virtual_power_plant and
textcite:nguyen16_biddin. Uncertainties (e.g., renewable energy generation or
electricity prices) are modeled by a set of scenarios that are based on
historical data. Despite that, we consider RL as an optimal fit for the design
of our proposed intelligent agent. Given the ability to learn user behavior
(e.g., mobility demand) and the flexibility to adapt to the environment (e.g.,
electricity prices), RL methods are a promising way of solving complex
challenges in the smart grid.

** Reinforcement Learning Theory label:sec-reinforcement-learning
The following chapter will give an overview of the most important RL concepts
and will introduce the corresponding mathematical formulations. If not noted
otherwise, the notation, equations, and explanations are adapted from
textcite:sutton18_reinf, the de-facto reference book of RL research.

RL is an agent-based machine learning algorithm in which the agent learns to
perform an optimal set of actions through interaction with its environment. The
agents objective is to maximize the rewards it receives based on the actions it
takes. Immediate rewards have to be weighted against long-term cumulative
returns that depend on future actions of the agent. The RL problem is formalized
as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which will be introduced in Chapter
ref:sec-mdp. A critical task of RL agents is to continuously estimate the value
of the environment's state. State values indicate the long-term desirability of
a state, that is the total amount of reward the agent can expect to accumulate
in the future, following a learned set of actions, called the policy. Policies
and values are covered in Chapter ref:sec-policies, whereas the core
mathematical foundations for evaluating policies and updating value functions
are introduced in Chapter ref:sec-bellman. When the model of the environment is
fully known, the learning problem is reduced to a planning problem (see Chapter
ref:sec-dp) in which optimal policies can be computed with iterative approaches.
Model-free RL approaches can be applied when rewards and state transitions are
unknown, and the agent's behavior has to be learned from experience (see Chapter
ref:sec-td-learning). The last two chapters cover novel methods that solve the RL
problem more efficiently, tackle new challenges and are widely used in practice
and research.

*** Markov Decision Processes label:sec-mdp
MDPs are a classical formulation of sequential decision making and an idealized
mathematical formulation of the RL problem. They allow to derive exact
theoretical statements about the learning problem and possible solutions. Figure
ref:agent-environment-interaction depicts the /agent-environment interaction/.

In RL the agent and the environment continuously interact with each other. The
agent takes actions that influence the environment, which in return presents
rewards to the agent. The agent's goal is to maximize rewards over time, trough
an optimal choice of actions. In each discrete timestep $t\!=\!0,1,2,...,T$ the
RL agent interacts with the environment, which is perceived by the agent as a
representation, called /state/, $S_t \in \S$. Based on the state, the agents
selects an /action/, $A_t\in\A$, and receives a numerical /reward/ signal,
$R_{t+1}\in\R\subset\Re$, in the next timestep. Actions influence immediate
rewards and successive states, and consequently also influence future rewards.
The agent has to continuously make a trade-off between immediate rewards and
delayed rewards to achieve its long-term goal.

The /dynamics/ of an MDP are defined by the probability that a state $s'\in \S$
and a reward $r\in\R$ occurs, given the preceding state $s\in\S$ and action
$a\in\A$. In /finite/ MDPs, the random variables $R_t$ and $S_t$ have
well-defined probability density functions, which are solely dependent on the
previous state and the agent's action. Consequently, it is possible to define
($\defeq$) the /dynamics/ of the MDP as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-dynamics}
    p(s',r|s,a) \defeq \Pr{S_t=s',R_t=r|S_{t-1}=s,A_t=a},
\end{equation}
for all $s',s\!\in\!\S$, $r\!\in\!\R$ and $a\!\in\!\A$. Note that each possible
value of the state $S_t$ depends only on the immediately preceding state
$S_{t-1}$. When a state includes all information of all previous states, the
state possesses the so-called /Markov property/. If not noted otherwise, the
Markov property is assumed throughout the whole chapter. The dynamics function
eqref:eq-dynamics allows computing the /state-transition probabilities/,
another important characteristic of an MDP:
\begin{equation}
    p(s'|s,a) \defeq \Pr{S_t\!=\!s'|S_{t-1}\!=\!s,A_t\!=\!a} = \sum_{r\in\R}{p(s', r|s, a)},
\end{equation}
for $s',s\!\in\!\S$, $r\!\in\!\R$ and $a\!\in\!\A$.

The use of a /reward signal/ $R_t$ to formalize the agent's goal is a unique
characteristic of RL. Each timestep the agent receives the rewards as a scalar
value $R_t\in\Re$. The sole purpose of the RL agent is to maximize the
long-term cumulative reward (as opposed to the immediate reward). The long-term
cumulative reward can also be expressed as the /expected return/ $G_t$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-expected-return}
\begin{split}
    G_t &\defeq R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma R_{t+3} + \cdots \\
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}} \\
    &= R_{t+1} + \gamma G_{t+1},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$, $0\leq\gamma\leq 1$, is the /discount rate/ parameter. The
discount rate determines how "myopic" the agent is. If $\gamma$ approaches 0,
the agent is more concerned with maximizing immediate rewards. On the contrary,
when $\gamma\!=\! 1$, the agent takes future rewards strongly into account, the
agent is "farsighted".

*** Policies and Value Functions label:sec-policies
An essential task of almost every RL agent is estimating /value functions/.
These functions describe how "good" it is to be in a given state, or how "good"
it is to perform an action in a given state. More formally, they take a state
$s$ or a state-action pair $s,a$ as input and give the expected return $G_t$ as
output. The expected return is dependent on the actions the agent will take in
the future. Consequently, value functions are formulated with respect to a
/policy/ \pi. A policy is a mapping of states to actions; it describes the
probability that an agent performs a certain action dependent on the current
state. More formally, the policy is defined as
$\pi(a|s)\defeq\Pr{A_t\!=\!a|S_t\!=\!s}$, a probability density function of all
$a\!\in\!\A$ for each $s\!\in\!\S$. The various RL approaches mainly differ in how the
policy is updated, based on the agent's interaction with the environment.

In RL, not only value functions of states but also value functions of
state-action pairs are used. The /state-value function/ of policy $\pi$ is
denoted as $\vpi(s)$ and is defined as the expected return when starting in $s$
and following policy $\pi$:
\begin{equation}
    \vpi(s) \defeq \EE{\pi}{G_t|S_t\!=\!s}, \text{ for all } s\in\S
\end{equation}
The /action-value function/ of policy $\pi$ is denoted as $\qpi(s,a)$ and is
defined as the expected return when starting in $s$, taking action $a$ and
following policy $\pi$ afterwards:
\begin{equation}
    \qpi(s,a) \defeq \EE{\pi}{G_t|S_t\!=\!s, A_t\!=\!a}, \text{ for all } a\in\A, s\in\S
\end{equation}
The /optimal policy/ $\pi_*$ has a greater (or equal) expected return than all
other policies. The optimal state-value function and optimal action-value
function are defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \vstar(s) \defeq \max_{\pi} \vpi(s), \text{ for all } s\in\S
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \qstar(s,a) \defeq \max_{\pi} \qpi(s,a), \text{ for all } s\in\S, a\in\A
\end{equation}
The /optimal/ action-value function describes the expected return when taking
action $a$ in state $s$ following the optimal policy $\pi_*$ afterwards.
Estimating $\qstar$ to obtain an optimal policy is a substantial part of RL and
has been known as /Q-learning/ cite:watkins92_q_learn, which is described in
Chapter ref:sec-td-learning.

*** Bellman Equations label:sec-bellman
A central characteristic of value functions is their recursive relationship
between the state (or action) values. Similar to rewards in
(ref:eq-expected-return), current values are related to expected values of
successive states. This relationship is heavily used in RL and has been
formulated as /Bellman equations/ cite:bellman57_dynam_progr. The Bellman
equation for $\vpi(s)$ is defined as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-bellman}
\begin{split}
    \vpi(s) &\defeq \EE{\pi}{G_t|S_t=s} \\
    &= \EE{\pi}{R_{t+1}+\gamma G_{t+1}|S_t\!=\!s} \\
    &= \sum_{a}{\pi(a|s)}\sum_{s',r}{p(s',r|s,a)}\bigg[r+\gamma\vpi(s')\bigg],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a\!\in\!\A$, $s,s'\!\in\!\S$, $r\!\in\!\R$. In other words, the value of
a state equals the immediate reward plus the expected value of all possible
successor states, weighted by their probability of occurring. The value function
$\vpi(s)$ is the unique solution to its Bellman equation. The Bellman equation
of the optimal value function $v_*$ is called the /Bellman optimality equation/:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-bellman-optimality}
\begin{split}
    \vstar(s) &\defeq \max_{a\in\A(s)}q_{\pi_*}(s,a) \\
    &= \max_{a}\EE{\pi_*}{R_{t+1}+\gamma G_{t+1}|S_t\!=\!s, A_t\!=a} \\
    &= \max_{a}\EE{\pi_*}{R_{t+1}+\gamma \vstar(S_{t+1})|S_t\!=\!s, A_t\!=a} \\
    &= \max_{a}\sum_{s',r}{p(s',r|s,a)}\bigg[r+\gamma\vstar(s')\bigg]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a\!\in\!\A$, $s,s'\!\in\!\S$, $r\!\in\!\R$. In other words, the value of
a state under an optimal policy equals the expected return for the best action
from that state. Note that the Bellman optimality equation does not refer to a
specific policy, it has a unique solution independent from one. It can be seen
as an equation system, which can be solved when the dynamics of the environment
eqref:eq-dynamics are fully known. Similar Bellman equations as
eqref:eq-bellman and eqref:eq-bellman-optimality can also be formed for
$\qpi(s,a)$ and $\qstar(s,a)$. Bellman equations form the basis for computing
and approximating value functions and were an important milestone in RL history.
Most RL methods are /approximately/ solving the Bellman optimality equation, by
using experienced state transitions instead of expected transition
probabilities. The most common methods will be explored in the following
chapters.

*** Dynamic Programming label:sec-dp
/Dynamic programming/ (DP) is a method to compute optimal policies, the primary
goal of every RL method. DP makes use of value functions to facilitate the
search for good policies. Once an optimal value function, (i.e., one that
satisfies the Bellman optimality equation) is found, optimal policies can be
easily obtained. Despite the limited utility of DP in real-world settings, it
provides the theoretical foundation for all RL methods. In fact, all of the RL
methods try to achieve the same goal, but without the assumption of a perfect
model of the environment and less computational effort. Because DP assumes full
knowledge of the environment, it is known as /planning/, in which optimal
solutions are /computed/. In /control/ problems (see Chapter
ref:sec-td-learning), optimal solutions are /learned/ from an unknown
environment.

The two most popular DP algorithms that compute optimal policies are called
/policy iteration/ and /value iteration/. These methods perform "sweeps" through
the whole state set and update the estimated value of each state via an
/expected update/ operation. In policy iteration, a value function for a given
policy $\vpi$ needs to be computed first, a step called /policy evaluation/. A
sequence of approximated value functions $\{v_k\}$ are updated using the Bellman
equation for $\vpi$ eqref:eq-bellman until convergence to $\vpi$ is achieved.
After computing the value function for a given policy, it is possible to modify
the policy and see if the value $\vpi(s)$ for a given state increases (/policy
improvement/). A way of doing this, is evaluating the action-value function
$\qpi(s,a)$ by /greedily/ taking the best short-term action $a\!\in\!A$ without
forward looking behaviour. Alternating between these two steps monotonically
improves the policies and the value functions until they converge to the
optimum. This algorithm is called /policy iteration/:
\begin{equation}
    \pi_0 \xrightarrow{\text{ E }} v_{\pi_0} \xrightarrow{\text{ I }}
    \pi_1 \xrightarrow{\text{ E }} v_{\pi_1} \xrightarrow{\text{ I }}
    \pi_2 \xrightarrow{\text{ E }} \hdots \xrightarrow{\text{ I }}
    \pi_* \xrightarrow{\text{ E }} \vstar,
\end{equation}
where $\xrightarrow{\text{ E }}$ denotes a policy evaluation step,
$\xrightarrow{\text{ I }}$ denotes a policy improvement step. $\pi_*$ and
$\vstar$ denote the optimal policy and optimal value function, respectively.
Note that in each iteration of the policy iteration algorithm, a policy
evaluation has to be performed, which requires multiple sweeps through the state
space and is computationally expensive. In contrast, the /value iteration/
algorithm stops the policy evaluation step after one sweep. In this case, the
two previous steps can be combined into one single update step:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    v_{k+1}(s) &\defeq \max_a \EE{}{R_{t+1}+\gamma \vstar(S_{t+1})|S_t\!=\!s, A_t\!=a} \\
    &= \max_{a}\sum_{s',r}{p(s',r|s,a)}\bigg[r+\gamma v_k(s')\bigg],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a\!\in\!\A$, $s,s'\!\in\!\S$, $r\!\in\!\R$. It can be shown, that for any
given $v_0$, the sequence ${v_k}$ converges to the optimal value function
${\vstar}$. In value iteration, the Bellman optimality equation
eqref:eq-bellman-optimality is simply turned into an update rule. Both of the
algorithms can be effectively used to compute optimal values and value function
in finite MDPs with a fully known model of the environment.

*** Temporal-Difference Learning label:sec-td-learning
The previous chapter dealt with solving a planning problem, that is, computing
an optimal solution (i.e., an optimal policy $\pi_*$) of an MDP when a model of
the environment is fully known. In the following chapters, we will look at
/model-free/ prediction and model-free control. As opposed to planning,
model-free methods learn from experience and require no prior knowledge of the
environment. Remarkably, these methods can still achieve optimal behavior.

# NOTE: Section: Model-free TD Prediction
The TD /prediction problem/ is concerned with estimating state-values $\vpi$
using past experiences of following a given policy $\pi$. TD methods update an
estimate $V$ of $\vpi$ in every timestep $t$. At time $t\!+\!1$ they immediately
perform an update operation on $V(S_t)$. Because of the step-by-step nature of
TD learning, it is categorized as /online learning/. Also note that TD methods
perform update operations on value estimates based on other learned estimates, a
procedure called bootstrapping. In simple TD prediction, the value estimates
$V$ are updated as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq-td-prediction}
    V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha\big[R_{t+1}+\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\big],
\end{equation}
where \alpha is a constant step-size parameter and \gamma is the
discount rate. Here, the update of the state-value is performed using the
observed reward $R_{t+1}$ and the estimated value $V(S_{t+1})$.

When a model is not available, it is useful to estimate /action-values/, instead
of /state-values/. If the environment is completely known, it is possible for
the agent to look one step ahead and select the best action. Without that
knowledge, the value of each action in a given state needs to be estimated. The
latter constitutes a problem, since not every /state-action/ pair will be
visited when the agent follows a deterministic policy. A deterministic policy
$\pi(a|s)$ returns exactly one action given the current state, hence the agent
will only observe returns for one of the actions. In order to evaluate the value
function for all state-action pairs $\qpi$, continuous exploration needs to be
ensured. In other words, the agent has to explore state-action pairs which are
seemingly disadvantageous given the current policy. This dilemma is also known
as the /exploration-exploitation/ trade-off. One way to achieve exploration is
using /stochastic/ policies for action selection. Stochastic policies have a
non-zero probability of selecting each action in each state. A typical
stochastic policy is the /\epsilon-greedy policy/, which selects the action with
the highest estimated value, except for a given probability \epsilon, it selects
an action at random.

There are two approaches to make use of stochastic policies to ensure all
actions are chosen infinitely often. Figure ref:fig-sarsa depicts the learning
process of /on-policy/ methods. They improve the stochastic decision policy, by
continually estimating $\qpi$ in regard to $\pi$ (left panel), while
simultaneously driving $\pi$ towards $\qpi$, for example with an \epsilon-greedy
action selection (right panel). In contrast, /off-policy/ methods improve the
deterministic decision policy, by using a second stochastic policy to generate
behavior. The first policy is becoming the optimal policy by evaluating the
exploratory behavior of the second policy. Off-policy approaches are
considered more powerful than on-policy approaches and have a variety of
additional use cases, such as being able to learn from data generated by a human
expert. On the other side, they have shown to have a higher variance and take
more time to converge to an optimum.

# NOTE: Section: Sarsa: On-policy TD Control
A popular on-policy TD control method is Sarsa, developed by
textcite:rummery94_q. In the prediction step, the action-value function
$\qpi(s,a)$ of all actions and states has to be estimated for the current
policy $\pi$. The estimation can be done similar to TD prediction of state
values eqref:eq-td-prediction. Instead of considering state transitions,
state-action transitions are considered in this case. The update rule is
constructed as follows:
\begin{equation}
    Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha\big[R_{t+1}+\gamma Q(S_{t+1},A_{t+1}) - Q(S_t, A_t)\big]
\end{equation}
After every transition from a state $S_t$, an update operation using the events
$(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})$ is performed. This quintuple also
constituted the name Sarsa. The on-policy control step of the algorithm is
straightforward, and uses an \epsilon-greedy policy improvement, as described in
the previous paragraph. It has been shown that Sarsa converges to the optimal
policy $\pi_*$ under the assumption of infinite visits to all state-action
pairs, a rather restrictive assumption considering the enormous state and
actions spaces of real-world applications.

# NOTE: Section: Q-learning: Off-policy TD Control
A breakthrough in RL has been achieved when textcite:watkins92_q_learn developed
the off-policy TD control algorithm /Q-learning/, in which the update
rule is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha\big[R_{t+1}+\gamma\max_a Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t, A_t)\big]
\end{equation}
Here, the action-value estimates $Q$ are updated towards the highest estimated
action-value of the next time step. In this way, $Q$ directly approximates the
optimal action-value function $q_*$, independently of the policy the agent
follows. Due to this simplification, Q-learning is a widely used model-free
method, and its convergence can be proved easily
cite:watkins89_learn_from_delay_rewar.

This chapter covered the most important RL methods. They work online, learn from
experience, and can be easily applied to real-world problems with low
computational effort. Moreover, the mathematical complexity of the presented
approaches is limited, and they can be easily implemented into computer
programs. TD learning is a /tabular/ method, in which Q-values
are stored and updated in a lookup table. If the state and action spaces are
continuous or the number of states and actions is very large, a table
representation is computational infeasible and the speed of convergence is
drastically reduced. In this case, a function approximator can replace the
lookup table. The next chapter will briefly cover function approximation, as
well as other advancements in RL.
*** Approximation Methods label:sec-rl-fa
Up to this point, only tabular RL methods have been covered, which form the
theoretical foundation of RL. But in many real-world use cases, the state space
is enormous and it is improbable to find an optimal value function with tabular
methods. Not only is it a problem to store such a large table in the memory, but
also would it take an almost infinite amount of time to fill every entry with
meaningful results. Contrarily, /function approximation/ tries to find a
function that approximates the optimal value function as closely as possible,
with limited computational resources. The agent's experience with a small subset
of visited states is generalized to approximate values of the whole state set.
Function approximation has been widely studied in supervised machine learning.
Gradient methods, as well as linear and non-linear model have shown good results
for RL.

The approximated value of a state $s$ is denoted as the parameterized functional
form $\hat v(s,\w)\!\approx\!\vpi(s)$, given a weight vector $\w\!\in\!\Re^d$.
Function approximation methods are approximating $\vpi$ by learning (i.e.,
adjusting) the weight vector $\w$ from the experience of following the policy
$\pi$. By assumption, the dimensionality $d$ of $\w$ is much lower than the
number of states, which is the reason for the desired generalization effect;
adjusting one weight affects the values of many states. However, optimizing an
estimate for one state also decreases the accuracy of the estimates for other
states. This effect motivates the specification of a state distribution
$\mu(s)$, which represents the importance of the prediction error for each
state. In on-policy prediction, $\mu(s)$ is often selected to be the proportion
of time spend in each state $s$. The prediction error of a state is defined as
the squared difference between the predicted (i.e., approximated) value $\hat
v(s,\w)$ and the true value $\vpi(s)$. Consequently, the objective function of
the supervised learning problem can be defined as the /mean squared value error/
$\MSVEm$, which weights the prediction error with the state distribution
$\mu(s)$:
\begin{equation}
    \MSVEm(\w) \defeq \sum_{s\in\S}{\mu(s)\bigg[\vpi(s)-\hat v(s,\w)\bigg]^2}, \text{ where } \w\in\Re^d
\end{equation}
Minimizing $\MSVEm$ in respect to $\hat v$ will yield a value function, which
facilitates finding a better policy --- the primary goal of RL. Remember that
$\hat v$ can take any form of a linear or non-linear function of the state $s$.

In practice, deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown great success as
function approximators, which coined the term /deep reinforcement learning/
cite:mnih15_human_level_contr_throug_deep_reinf_learn,silver16_master_game_go_with_deep.
A simplified ANN that approximates the action-value function $\qpi(s,a)$ can be
found in Figure ref:fig-ann. In this example, the network estimates Q-values of
the combination of four states and two actions. ANNs have the advantage that
they can theoretically approximate any continuous function by adjusting the
connection weights of the network $\w\in\Re^{d\times d}$
cite:cybenko89_approx_by_super_sigmoid_funct. Advancements in the field of /deep
learning/ facilitated remarkable performance improvements in RL applications.
For the model of our research, we use /double deep Q-Networks/
cite:hasselt16_deep_reinf_learn_doubl_q_learn, which we will introduce in
Chapter ref:sec-model-algo. Despite that, RL theory is mostly limited to tabular
and linear approximation methods. Refer to
textcite:bengio09_learn_deep_archit_ai for a comprehensive review of deep
learning methods.

*** Further Topics
The previous chapters provided a detailed overview of the most important
concepts and mathematical foundations in RL. The literature has produced many
more methods that were not covered here. /Eligibility traces/ offer a way to
more general learning and faster convergence rates. Almost any TD method can be
extended to use eligibility traces, a popular methods is called Watkins's
Q($\lambda$) cite:watkins89_learn_from_delay_rewar. /Fitted-Q Iteration/
cite:ernst03_iterat combined Q-learning and fitted value iteration with
batch-mode RL. In batch-mode the whole dataset is available offline, contrary to
online RL where the data is acquired by the agent's action in its the
environment. /Actor-critic/ methods
cite:sutton84_tempor_credit_assig_reinf_learn directly learn a parameterized
policy instead of action-values, which inherently allow continuous state spaces
and learning appropriate levels of exploration. Simultaneously to learning the
policy, they approximate a state-value function, which serves as a "critic" to
the learned policy, the "actor". In the current theory most RL models are
single-agent models. For certain real-world applications multi-agent RL
algorithms are necessary to coordinate interaction between the agents. When
multiple learning agents interact with a non-stationary environment, convergence
and stability are a serious problem. /W-learning/
cite:humphrys96_action_selec_method_using_reinf_learn is an multi-agent approach
that aims to solve these difficulties.
