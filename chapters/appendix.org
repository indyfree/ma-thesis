* Appendix: Data Preprocessing label:app-data-processing
The raw Car2Go dataset contained about 63 million data points (7.82 GB) and has
been processed to only contain about 1.25 thousand data points (100 MB), while
still compromising all necessary information. The following preprocessing steps
have been taken to prepare the data for further analysis:

1) Determine rental trips

   Rental trips were inferred based on changing GPS coordinates between two data
   points of the same EV (see Table ref:table-car2go-raw, 4^{th} to 5^{th} row).
   Since the GPS accuracy of industry sensors is approximately 5 meters under
   open sky, and worse near buildings, bridges, and trees [fn:1], measurement
   errors occur. To reduce the number of falsely identified trips, a decreased
   resolution of a 10-meter radius was calculated. Note that we hereby assume
   that customers do not undertake trips, which begin and end at the same
   location. In total, 1246040 customer rentals were determined.

2) Determine trip distances

   The trip distances were inferred based on the difference in SoC level before
   and after the rental and the average energy consumption per kilometer.
   Although the real distance that can be covered with a certain amount of
   energy depends on driving style and traffic situation, we are confident that
   the deviation will be small, since all trips take place within the same urban
   space.

3) Determine rental profits

   The rental profits were inferred based on the trip duration and the estimated
   trip distance. Car2Go has a minutely pricing scheme with an additional long
   distance fee that applies when the customer drives more than a specified
   range. The rental profits form an important piece of information for our
   model since they determine the opportunity cost $\rho$ the fleet controller
   has to account for if it denies the rental in favor of VPP activities.

4) Clean data
   - /Service trips/: 3308 rental trips were removed that had a trip duration
     longer than the maximum allowed rental time of two days. We assume that
     these trips were /service trips/ undertaken by Car2Go. When the EVs
     returned with a higher SoC (e.g., they have been charged at the car repair
     shop), the previous trip had to be altered to end at a charging station to
     ensure charging consistency.
   - /Incorrectly charged EVs/: 52 EVs were removed that showed incorrect
     charging behavior. These EVs reported a battery level increase of more than 20%
     between trips or during trips, while not being located at a charging station.
