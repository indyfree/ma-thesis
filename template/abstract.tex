\section*{Abstract}
Integrating weather-dependent renewable energy resources into the electricity
system imposes challenges on the power grid. Balancing services are needed which
can be provided by virtual power plants (VPP) that aggregate decentralized
energy sources to consume or produce electricity on demand. Electric vehicle
(EV) fleets can use the batteries of idle cars as combined storage to offer
balancing services on smart electricity markets. However, there are risks
associated with this business model extension. The fleet faces severe imbalance
penalties if it can not charge the offered amount of balancing energy due to
unpredicted mobility demand of the vehicles. It is at the risk of denying
profitable customer rentals to ensure the fleet can fulfill all market
commitments. We study the design of a decision support system that estimates
these risks, dynamically adjust the composition of a VPP portfolio, and
profitably places bids on multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Here we
show that a reinforcement learning agent can optimize the VPP portfolio by
learning from favorable market conditions and fleet demand uncertainties. In
comparison to previous research, in which the bidding risks were unknown and
fleets could only offer conservative amounts of balancing power to a single
market, our proposed approach increases the amount of offered balancing power by
$48\% - 82\%$  and achieves a charging cost reduction of the fleet by 25\%. In
experiments with real-world carsharing data of 500 EVs, we found that the
accuracy of mobility demand forecasting algorithms is crucial for a successful
bidding strategy. Moreover, we show that recent advancements in deep
reinforcement learning decrease the convergence time and improve the robustness
of the results. Our results demonstrate how modern RL algorithms can be
successfully used for fleet management, VPP optimization and demand response in
the smart grid. We anticipate that distributed energy resources such as EVs will
play an essential role in providing reliable back up power for the grid and
formulate market design recommendations to allow easier access to these
resources.
