\subsection{Smart Charging and Balancing the Electric Grid with EV Fleets}
\label{sec:org9d2281d}
The increasing penetration of EVs has a substantial effect on electricity consumption
patterns. During charging periods, power flows and grid losses increase
considerably and challenge the grid. Operators have to reinforce the grid
to ensure that transformers and substations do not get overloaded
\parencite{sioshansi12_impac_elect_tarif_plug_in,lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system}.
Loading multiple EVs in the same neighborhood, or worse, whole EV fleets at
once, stress the grid. In these cases, even brown- or blackouts are possible
\parencite{kim12_carbit}. Despite these challenges, it is possible to postpone the
physical reinforcement by adopting smart charging strategies. In smart charging,
EVs get charged when the grid is less congested to achieve more grid stability.
Smart charging reduces peaks in electricity demand, called \emph{Peak Cutting} and
complement the grid in times of low demand, called \emph{Valley Filling}. Smart
charging has been researched thoroughly in the IS literature, in the following
we will outline some of the most important contributions.

\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} find that using intelligent
agents to schedule EV charging substantially reshapes the energy demand and
reduces peak demand without violating individual household preferences. Moreover,
they show that the proposed smart charging behavior reduced average energy
prices and thus economically benefit households. In another study
\textcite{kara15_estim_benef_elect_vehic_smart} investigate the effect of smart
charging on public charging stations in California. Controlling for
arrival and departure times, the authors present beneficial results for the
distribution system operator (DSO) and the owners of EVs. A price
reduction in energy bills and a peak load reduction could be determined.
An extension of the smart charging concept is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). When
equipped with V2G devices, EVs can discharge their batteries back into the grid.
Several authors researched this technology in respect to grid stabilization
effects and arbitrage possibilities.
\textcite{schill11_elect_vehic_imper_elect_market} find that EVs can be beneficial
for average consumer electricity prices. Excess EV battery capacity can be used
to charge in off-peak hours and discharge in peak hours when the prices are
higher. These arbitrage possibilities reverse welfare effects of generators
and increase general overall welfare and consumer surplus.
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor} show that the
arbitrage opportunities are especially prominent when a high variability in
electricity prices on the target electricity market exists. The authors state
that short intervals between the contract of sale and the physical delivery of
electricity increase arbitrage benefits. Consequently, ancillary service markets,
like frequency control and operating reserve markets, are attractive for smart
charging.

\textcite{peterson10_econom_using_plug_in_hybrid} investigate energy arbitrage
profitability with V2G in the light of battery depreciation costs in the US.
Their results indicate that large-scale use of EV batteries for grid storage
does not yield enough profits to incentivize EV owners to participate in V2G
activities. Considering battery depreciation cost, they arrive at an annual
profit of only 6\$ - 72\$ per EV.
\textcite{brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ} evaluated a business
model for parking garage operators operating on the German frequency regulation
market. When taking infrastructure costs and battery depreciation costs into
account, they concluded that the proposed vehicle-grid integration is not
profitable. Even with generous assumptions about EV adoption rates in Germany
and altered auction mechanisms they arrived at negative profits.
\textcite{kahlen17_fleet} used EV fleets to offer balancing services to the grid.
Evaluating the impact of V2G in their model the authors conclude that V2G would
only be profitable if reserve power prices would be twice as high. Given the
results from the studies mentioned above, we decided not to include V2G into our
model, since expected profits are marginal.

In order to maximize profits, it is essential for market participants to develop good
bidding strategies. Successful bidding strategies to jointly participate in
multiple markets have been developed, e.g., by
\textcite{mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2}. The authors use
stationary battery storage to participate in the spinning reserve market and
the day-ahead market at the same time. They developed a non-equilibrium model,
which solves the presented mixed-integer program with Genetic Programming (GP).
Contrarily, we use a model-free RL agent that learns an optimal policy (i.e.,
a trading strategy) from actions it takes in the environment (i.e., bidding on
electricity markets). Using a model-free approach is especially beneficial for
us, since additional unknown variables and constraints (i.e., customer mobility
demand), make it complicated to formulate a mathematical model.

\textcite{he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag} have done similar research to
\textcite{mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2}. The authors additionally
incorporate battery life cycle in their profit maximization model,
which proves to be a decisive factor. In contrast to the authors, we jointly
participated in the secondary operating reserve and spot market with the
\emph{non-stationary} storage of EV batteries. Because shared EVs have to satisfy
mobility demands, they have to be charged in any case, which allows us to safely
exclude battery deprecation from our model. Further, we chose the intraday
market over the day-ahead market, as it has the lowest reaction time of the spot
markets, and thus potentially offers higher profits
\parencite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}.

Previous studies often assume that car owners or households can directly trade
on electricity markets. In reality, this is not possible due to the minimum
capacity requirements of the markets, that single EVs do not meet. For example,
the German Control Reserve Market (GCRM) has a minimum trading capacity of 1MW
to 5MW, depending on the specific market. In order to reach the minimum
capacity, over 200 EVs would need to be connected to the grid via a standard
4.6kW charging station at the same time. \textcite{ketter13_power_tac} introduced
the notion of electricity brokers, aggregators that act on behalf of a group of
individuals or households to participate in electricity markets.
\textcite{brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ} and
\textcite{kahlen14_balan_with_elect_vehic} successfully showed in their studies
that electricity brokers could overcome the capacity issues by aggregating EV
batteries. In addition to electricity brokers, we apply the concept of Virtual
Power Plants (VPPs). VPPs are flexible portfolios of distributed energy
resources, which are presented with a single load profile to the system
operator, making them eligible for market participation and ancillary service
provisioning \parencite{pudjianto07_virtual_power_plant_system_integ}. Hence, VPPs
allow providing regulation capacity to the market without knowing which exact
sources provide the promised capacity until the delivery time
\parencite{kahlen17_fleet}. This concept is specially useful when dealing with
EV fleets: VPPs enable carsharing providers to issue bids and asks based on an
estimate of available fleet capacity, without knowing beforehand which exact EVs
will provide the capacity at the time of delivery. Based on the battery charge
and the availability EVs, an intelligent agent will decide in real-time which
vehicles provide the capacity.

Carsharing providers manage large EV fleets, which makes it possible for them to
use the presented concepts as a viable business extension. We look at free float
carsharing, a popular concept where cars can be picked up and parked everywhere,
and billing is done by the minute. Free float carsharing offers more flexibility
to its users, saves resources and reduces carbon emissions
\parencite{firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities}. In most previous
studies concerned with using EVs for electricity trading, it was assumed that
trips are fixed and known in advance, e.g., in
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}. The free float
concept adds uncertainty and nondeterministic behavior, which make predictions
about future rentals a complex issue.

\textcite{kahlen17_fleet} showed that it is possible to use free float carsharing
fleets as VPPs to profitably offer balancing services to the grid. The authors
compared cases from three different cities across Europe and the US.
They used an event-based simulation, bootstrapped with real-world carsharing
and secondary operating reserve market data from the respective cities, to
arrive at their results. A central dilemma within this research is to decide
whether an EV should be committed to a VPP or to be free for rent, in the core a
classification problem. Since rental profits are considerably higher than
profits from electricity trading, it is crucial not to allocate an EV to a VPP
when it could have been rented out otherwise. To deal with the asymmetric
payoff, \citeauthor{kahlen17_fleet} use stratified sampling in their classifier.
This method gives rental misclassifications higher weights, which reduces the
likelihood of EVs to participate in VPP activities. The authors use a Random
Forest regression model to predict the available balancing capacity, which they
use to place bids and asks on the market. The predictions are made on an
aggregated fleet level, in order to leverage risk-pooling effects. The agent
decides which EVs will provide the regulation capacity at the delivery time
based on the likelihood that the vehicle is rented out and on the expected
(predicted) benefits of the EV.
In a similar study, the authors showed that carsharing companies could
participate in day-ahead markets for arbitrage purposes
\parencite{kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem}. In this paper, the
authors use a time-series model to predict available trading capacity, due to
less time between commitment and delivery. Another central problem for
the carsharing provider is that committed trades which can not be fulfilled result
in substantial penalties from the system operator or electricity exchange. In
other words, it should be avoided at all costs, that the fleet commits to buy
any amount of electricity, for which it does not have enough available EVs to
charge it at delivery time. To address this issue, the authors develop a mean
asymmetric weighted (MAW) objective function. They use it for their time-series
based prediction model, to penalize committing an EV to VPP when it would have
been rented out otherwise.
Because of the two issues mentioned above,
\textcite{kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem} can only make very
conservative estimations and commitments of overall available trading capacity,
which results in a high amount of foregone profits. This effect is especially
prominent when participating in the secondary operating reserve market since
commitments have to be made one week in advance when mobility demands are
still uncertain. \textcite{kahlen17_fleet} state that in 42\% to 80\% of the cases
EVs are \emph{not} committed to a VPP when it would have been profitable to do so.

We are proposing a solution, in which the EV fleet participates in the balancing
market and intraday market simultaneously. With this approach, we align the
potentially higher profits on the balancing markets, already mentioned by
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}, with the more
accurate capacity estimations for intraday markets. We followed
\textcite{kahlen17_fleet} with this approach, who proposed to work on a combination
of multiple markets in the future.


\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Smart Grids}
\label{sec:orgaba83b6}

Previous research showed that intelligent agents equipped with Reinforcement
Learning methods can successfully take action in the smart grid.
\textcite{reddy11_strat,reddy11_learn_behav_multip_auton_agent} conducted
research, in which autonomous broker agents \parencite{ketter13_power_tac} learn
their strategies using RL. \textcite{peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton} build
on that work and further enhance the method, by learning over larger state
spaces to accommodate arbitrary economic signals. This method is especially
beneficial in smart markets because the markets structures might change in the
future and intelligent agents should adapt to a variety of market structures and
conditions.

\parencite{vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon}


\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} adopt RL methods to learn
electricity consumption behavior of households. The authors implement these
methods in intelligent agents to smart charge EVs more effectively.
\textcite{vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet} use RL to learn collective EV
fleet charging behavior to profitably purchase electricity on the day-ahead
market. We consider RL a perfect fit for the design of our proposed intelligent
agent, especially as a solution for our Research Question 2. When dynamically
optimizing the VPP portfolio composition of the fleet, there is no historical
data available to train a model. Using RL and a reward function that maximizes
the overall profitability of the fleet, the agent can learn from its environment
with unknown dynamics and take a certain set of actions. The agent can consider
different states (e.g., current and forecasted rental demand levels and
electricity prices) to take actions (e.g., allocate battery capacity to different
types of VPPs) that maximizes the reward function.
