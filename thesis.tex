\subsection{Research Motivation}
\label{sec:org984852a}
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system}
\end{itemize}
It is also expected that the amount of intermittent RES
that can be safely integrated into the electric power system
may increase due to EV storage capacity [11]. Given the
uncontrollability of these energy sources, since they only
produce energy when the primary renewable resource is
available, EV capability to store energy and inject it later
into the system will avoid spillage of clean energy,
resulting in the decreased usage of the conventional fossil
fuel units and expensive generators during peak hours.

\subsection{Smart Charging and Balancing the Electric Grid with EV Fleets}
\label{sec:org1917fbe}
The increasing penetration of EVs has a substantial effect on electricity consumption
patterns. During charging periods, power flows and grid losses increase
considerably and challenge the grid. Operators have to reinforce the grid in
order that transformers and substations don't get overloaded
\parencite{lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system}. Loading multiple EVs in the
same neighbourhood, or worse whole EV fleets at once, stress the grid.
\textcite{kim12_carbit} find that in these cases, even brown- or blackouts are
possible. Despite these challenges, it is possible to postpone the physical
reinforcement by adopting smart charging strategies \parencite{kim12_carbit}. In
smart charging, EVs get charged when the grid is less congested to achieve more
grid stability. Smart charging reduces peaks in electricity demand ("Peak Cutting") and
complement times of low demand ("Valley Filling").

\begin{itemize}
\item Peak demand usually occurs then and then
\item Smart charging has a vast body of literature
\item Smart charging price incentives (Kahlen, Vallogiani)
\end{itemize}

\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} find that using intelligent
agents to facilitate smart charging, can substantially benefit households.
\textcite{kara15_estim_benef_elect_vehic_smart} present results, in which smart
charging reduced electricity bills for users of public EV charging stations in
California.

An extension of the smart charging concept is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). EVs
equipped with V2G devices can discharge their batteries back into the grid.
\textcite{schill11_elect_vehic_imper_elect_market} find that EVs can be beneficial
for consumer electricity prices when they are used as storage. Similar results were shown by
\textcite{reichert10_consid_highl_effic_bidir_batter} and
\textcite{peterson10_econom_using_plug_in_hybrid}, they point out that battery
technology and battery costs are a crucial factor for profitability.
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor} show that V2G can
profitable, especially when there is a high variability in electricity prices on
the market. The authors state that shorter intervals between sale and physical
delivery increase the benefits.

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain and prove why leaving out V2G.
\end{itemize}
Successful trading strategies to jointly participate in multiple markets have
been developed by \textcite{mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2}. Using
stationary storage the authors use VPPs to participate in the spinning reserve
market and day-ahead market at the same time. Similar research has been done by
\textcite{he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag}. The authors take the battery
life cycle into account, which proves to be a decisive factor. In contrast, we
aim to jointly participate in the operating reserve and spot market with
\emph{non-stationary} storage, while considering the battery life cycle as well.
Following the findings of
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}, we choose the
intraday continuous market over the day-ahead market, as it has the lowest
reaction time of the spot markets.


Previous studies often make the assumption that car owners or households can
directly trade on electricity markets. In reality, this is not possible due to
minimum capacity requirements of the markets. For example, the German secondary
reserve market has a 1 MW minimum trading capacity, while the maximum battery
capacity of i.e. a \emph{Smart ForTwo Electric} is 16.50 kWh.
\begin{itemize}
\item And a "normal" charger has 4.6kW to 22kW.
\end{itemize}
\textcite{ketter13_power_tac} introduced the notion of electricity brokers,
intelligent agents that act on behalf of a group of individuals or households to
participate on electricity markets.
\textcite{brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ} and
\textcite{kahlen14_balan_with_elect_vehic} successfully showed in simulations that
electricity brokers can overcome the capacity issues by aggregating distributed
electricity sources.

Carsharing providers which manage large EV fleets, can use their EVs as VPPs to
participate on electricity markets. We look at the concept of free float
carsharing, an approach which offers more flexibility to its users, saves
resources and reduces carbon emissions
\parencite{firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities}. In most previous
studies concerning using EVs for electricity trading, it was assumed that trips
are fixed and known in advance. The free float concept adds uncertainty and
nondeterministic behavior, as cars can be picked up and parked everywhere and
billing is done by the minute. This makes predictions about the where and when
of a car rental a complex issue. \textcite{wagner16_in_free_float} address this
problem by taking Points of Interests from Google Maps as an additional
predictor.

\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor,kahlen17_fleet} showed
that is possible to use free floating carsharing fleets as VPPs to profitably
offer balancing services to the grid. The authors also showed that with a
similar approach, carsharing companies can participate on day-ahead markets for
arbitrage purposes \parencite{kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem}. A
central dilemma within this research is to decide whether an EV should be
committed to being used as a VPP or to be free for rent. Rental
profits are considerably higher than profits to be made from electricity
trading.

\begin{itemize}
\item So you don't want to allocate a EV to VPP when it could have been rented out
\item A central point are  the prediction are made on a aggregated fleet level, how
much capacity you want to trade
\item Allocations are then made on likelihood that a Car is rented out and expected
benefits
\end{itemize}

Another central problem is that offering capacity to the grid, which
you can not provide, results in heavy penalties, which should be avoided at all
costs. To address this issue, the authors make use of asymmetric objective
functions that heavily penalize committing an EV to a VPP, when it would have
been rented otherwise. Therefore only very conservative estimations and
commitments of available overall capacity to be traded on the markets are made.
This results in a high amount of foregone profits when bidding on the balancing
market. \textcite{kahlen15_aggreg_elect_cars_sustain_virtual_power_plant} state
that in 42\% to 80\% of the time EVs are \emph{not} committed to a VPP when it would have been
profitable (i.e. the EV has not been rented out).

We are proposing a solution, in which the EV fleet participates on the balancing
market and intraday market simultaneously. With this approach we aim to align
the potentially higher profits on the balancing markets with the more accurate
capacity estimations, which can be made on intraday markets (because time
between commitment and delivery is smaller). We follow
\textcite{kahlen15_aggreg_elect_cars_sustain_virtual_power_plant} with this
approach, who also propose a combination of multiple markets in future work on
this topic.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Smart Grids}
\label{sec:orgf875efc}

Previous research showed that intelligent agents equipped with Reinforcement
Learning methods can successfully take action in the smart grid.
\textcite{reddy11_strat,reddy11_learn_behav_multip_auton_agent} conducted
research, in which autonomous broker agents \parencite{ketter13_power_tac} learn
their strategies using RL. \textcite{peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton} build
on that work and further enhance the method, by learning over larger state
spaces to accommodate arbitrary economic signals. This is especially beneficial
in smart markets, because the markets structures might change in the future and
intelligent agents should adapt to a variety of market structures and
conditions.

\parencite{vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon}


\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} adopt RL methods to learn
electricity consumption behavior of households. The authors implement these
methods in intelligent agents to smart charge EVs more effectively.
\textcite{vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet} use RL to learn collective EV
fleet charging behavior to profitably purchase electricity on the day-ahead
market. We consider RL a perfect fit for the design of our proposed intelligent
agent, especially as a solution for our Research Question 2. When dynamically
optimizing the VPP portfolio composition of the fleet, there is no historical
data available to train a model. Using RL and a reward function that maximizes
the overall profitability of the fleet, the agent can learn from its environment
with unknown dynamics and take a certain set of actions. The agent can consider
different states (e.g. current and forecasted rental demand levels and
electricity prices) to take actions (e.g. allocate battery capacity to different
types of VPPs) that maximizes the reward function.
