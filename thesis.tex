\subsection{Smart Charging and Balancing the Electric Grid with EV Fleets}
\label{sec:orge7e875a}
The increasing penetration of EVs has a substantial effect on electricity consumption
patterns. During charging periods, power flows and grid losses increase
considerably and challenge the grid. Operators have to reinforce the grid
to ensure that transformers and substations do not get overloaded
\parencite{sioshansi12_impac_elect_tarif_plug_in,lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system}.
Loading multiple EVs in the same neighbourhood, or worse, whole EV fleets at
once, stress the grid. In these cases, even brown- or blackouts are possible
\parencite{kim12_carbit}. Despite these challenges, it is possible to postpone the
physical reinforcement by adopting smart charging strategies. In smart charging,
EVs get charged when the grid is less congested to achieve more grid stability.
Smart charging reduces peaks in electricity demand, called \emph{Peak Cutting} and
complement the grid in times of low demand, called \emph{Valley Filling}. Smart
charging has been researched thoroughly in the IS literature.

\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} find that using intelligent
agents to schedule EV charging, substantially reshapes the energy demand and
reduces peak demand without violating individual household preferences. Moreover,
they show that the proposed smart charging behaviour reduced average energy
prices and thus economically benefit households. In another study
\textcite{kara15_estim_benef_elect_vehic_smart} investigate the effect of smart
charging on public charging stations in California. Controlling for
arrival and departure times, the authors present beneficial results for the
distribution system operator (DSO) and the owners of EVs. A price
reduction in energy bills and a peak load reduction could be determined.
An extension of the smart charging concept is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). When
equipped with V2G devices, EVs can discharge their batteries back into the grid.
Several authors conduct research on this technology in respect to grid stabilization
effects and arbitrage possibilities.
\textcite{schill11_elect_vehic_imper_elect_market} find that EVs can be beneficial
for average consumer electricity prices when the EVs can be used as storage.
Excess EV battery capacity can be used to charge in off-peak hours and discharge
in peak hours, when the prices are higher. These arbitrage possibilities,
reverses welfare effects of generators and increases general overall welfare and
consumer surplus. \textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}
show that the arbitrage opportunities are especially prominent when a high
variability in electricity prices on the target electricity market exists. The
authors state that short intervals between the contract of sale and the physical
delivery of electricity increase arbitrage benefits. Consequently ancillary service
markets, like frequency control and operating reserve markets are attractive for
smart charging.

\textcite{peterson10_econom_using_plug_in_hybrid} investigate energy arbitrage
profitability with V2G in the light of battery depreciation costs in the US.
Their results indicate that large-scale use of EV batteries for grid storage
does not yield enough profits to incentivize owners to participate in V2G
activities. Considering battery depreciation cost they arrive at an annual
profit of only 6\$ - 72\$ per EV.
\textcite{brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ} evaluated a business
model for parking garage operators operating on the German frequency regulation
market. When taking infrastructure costs and battery depreciation costs into
account they concluded that the proposed vehicle-grid
integration is not profitable. Even with generous assumptions about EV adoption
rates in Germany and altered auction mechanisms they arrived at negative profits.
\parencite{kahlen17_fleet} used EV fleets to offer balancing services to the grid.
Evaluating the impact of V2G in their model the authors come to the conclusion
that V2G would only be profitable if reserve power prices would be twice as
high. Given the results from the aforementioned studies, we decided not to
include V2G into our model, since expected profits are, at most, marginal.

Successful trading strategies to jointly participate in multiple markets have
been developed by \textcite{mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2}. Using
stationary storage the authors use VPPs to participate in the spinning reserve
market and day-ahead market at the same time. Similar research has been done by
\textcite{he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag}. The authors take the battery
life cycle into account, which proves to be a decisive factor. In contrast, we
aim to jointly participate in the operating reserve and spot market with
\emph{non-stationary} storage, while considering the battery life cycle as well.
Following the findings of
\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor}, we choose the
intraday continuous market over the day-ahead market, as it has the lowest
reaction time of the spot markets.


Previous studies often make the assumption that car owners or households can
directly trade on electricity markets. In reality, this is not possible due to
minimum capacity requirements of the markets. For example, the German secondary
reserve market has a 1 MW minimum trading capacity, while the maximum battery
capacity of i.e. a \emph{Smart ForTwo Electric} is 16.50 kWh.

\textcite{ketter13_power_tac} introduced the notion of electricity brokers,
intelligent agents that act on behalf of a group of individuals or households to
participate on electricity markets.
\textcite{brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ} and
\textcite{kahlen14_balan_with_elect_vehic} successfully showed in simulations that
electricity brokers can overcome the capacity issues by aggregating distributed
electricity sources.

Carsharing providers which manage large EV fleets, can use their EVs as VPPs to
participate on electricity markets. We look at the concept of free float
carsharing, an approach which offers more flexibility to its users, saves
resources and reduces carbon emissions
\parencite{firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities}. In most previous
studies concerning using EVs for electricity trading, it was assumed that trips
are fixed and known in advance. The free float concept adds uncertainty and
nondeterministic behavior, as cars can be picked up and parked everywhere and
billing is done by the minute. This makes predictions about the where and when
of a car rental a complex issue. \textcite{wagner16_in_free_float} address this
problem by taking Points of Interests from Google Maps as an additional
predictor.

\textcite{tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor,kahlen17_fleet} showed
that is possible to use free floating carsharing fleets as VPPs to profitably
offer balancing services to the grid. The authors also showed that with a
similar approach, carsharing companies can participate on day-ahead markets for
arbitrage purposes \parencite{kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem}. A
central dilemma within this research is to decide whether an EV should be
committed to being used as a VPP or to be free for rent. Rental
profits are considerably higher than profits to be made from electricity
trading.

Another central problem is that offering capacity to the grid, which
you can not provide, results in heavy penalties, which should be avoided at all
costs. To address this issue, the authors make use of asymmetric objective
functions that heavily penalize committing an EV to a VPP, when it would have
been rented otherwise. Therefore only very conservative estimations and
commitments of available overall capacity to be traded on the markets are made.
This results in a high amount of foregone profits when bidding on the balancing
market. \textcite{kahlen15_aggreg_elect_cars_sustain_virtual_power_plant} state
that in 42\% to 80\% of the time EVs are \emph{not} committed to a VPP when it would have been
profitable (i.e. the EV has not been rented out).

We are proposing a solution, in which the EV fleet participates on the balancing
market and intraday market simultaneously. With this approach we aim to align
the potentially higher profits on the balancing markets with the more accurate
capacity estimations, which can be made on intraday markets (because time
between commitment and delivery is smaller). We follow
\textcite{kahlen15_aggreg_elect_cars_sustain_virtual_power_plant} with this
approach, who also propose a combination of multiple markets in future work on
this topic.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Smart Grids}
\label{sec:org508772f}

Previous research showed that intelligent agents equipped with Reinforcement
Learning methods can successfully take action in the smart grid.
\textcite{reddy11_strat,reddy11_learn_behav_multip_auton_agent} conducted
research, in which autonomous broker agents \parencite{ketter13_power_tac} learn
their strategies using RL. \textcite{peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton} build
on that work and further enhance the method, by learning over larger state
spaces to accommodate arbitrary economic signals. This is especially beneficial
in smart markets, because the markets structures might change in the future and
intelligent agents should adapt to a variety of market structures and
conditions.

\parencite{vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon}


\textcite{valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag} adopt RL methods to learn
electricity consumption behavior of households. The authors implement these
methods in intelligent agents to smart charge EVs more effectively.
\textcite{vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet} use RL to learn collective EV
fleet charging behavior to profitably purchase electricity on the day-ahead
market. We consider RL a perfect fit for the design of our proposed intelligent
agent, especially as a solution for our Research Question 2. When dynamically
optimizing the VPP portfolio composition of the fleet, there is no historical
data available to train a model. Using RL and a reward function that maximizes
the overall profitability of the fleet, the agent can learn from its environment
with unknown dynamics and take a certain set of actions. The agent can consider
different states (e.g. current and forecasted rental demand levels and
electricity prices) to take actions (e.g. allocate battery capacity to different
types of VPPs) that maximizes the reward function.
