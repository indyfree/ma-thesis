#+TITLE: Thesis Todo

** TODO Use abbreviations only after 3+ mentions?

** TODO When webpage/pdf as source, put in bibtex not footnotes
** TODO Check page border spacing of Notation pages
** TODO First and last sentence of a paragraph should explain it well enough
** TODO Fix paragraph spacing

[[file:~/uni/ma-thesis/thesis.org::*Theoretical%20Background%20(10%25)][Theoretical Background (10%)]]
** TODO Concise Wording:
- regulation capacity, balancing power, frequency regulation...
- tender period, segment, interval, time period, tender/auction...
- carsharing company/provider
** TODO Comment Literature Review
Structure the whole section in a stricter way. I mean that the question I always
asked myself why reading was: "so what?" What is you Ziel? As far as I
understand, you wanna motivate you methodology by showing what previous
literature has done, and how the methodology can be improved (?). If this is the
case, I would state it clearly under Section 2. and then explain what is the
structure of 2.1 and 2.2.
Should you maybe provide more definition? In my guidelines, the literature
review is also the Teil in which I should have defined all the terms/concepts
that I used later on.
