# NOTE: 15%

The following chapter will cover the main results of this research. First, the
simulation environment is presented. Second, the economic sustainability of an
integrated bidding strategy is investigated. Third, the RL approach that aims to
optimize the VPP portfolio is evaluated. In the last section, we will perform
sensitivity analyses on the limiting algorithmic factor, the prediction
accuracy, and a limiting physical factor, the charging infrastructure.

** Simulation Environment
# NOTE: V2G?
As part of this research, we developed an event-based simulation platform called
/FleetSim/. On the platform, intelligent agents can centrally control the
charging of an EV fleet in a realistic setting. FleetSim allows researchers to
test out different smart charging and bidding strategies, based on real-world
data. The agents (i.e., fleet controllers) are responsible to sufficiently
charge their vehicles to satisfy real mobility demand. At the same time, they
can create VPP of EVs, provide balancing services to the grid, and take part in
electricity trading. Trips are simulated on an individual level, for example,
not charging an individual EV at a particular point in time, can cause a whole
series of lost rentals, due to an insufficient amount of battery for the next
arriving customers. The agents are evaluated based on the profits of charging
the fleet cheaper than the industry tariff, the costs of losing rentals and the
imbalance they cause if they can not provide market commitments. Additionally,
FleetSim facilitates easy sensitivity analyses, adaption to future market
designs, and integration of novel data sets through its modular architecture and
expandable design (see Figure ref:fig-fleetsim). We consider FleetSim as a
research platform for sustainable and smart mobility similar to PowerTac
cite:ketter16_multiagent_comp_gaming. It builds on SimPy[fn:1], a process-based
discrete-event simulation framework. FleetSim is available open source[fn:2] and
can be readily installed as a Python package.

In order to simplify comparability and focus to real-world applicability of the
analysis, we set the same parameters for all conducted experiments (see Table
ref:table-sim-params). They are corresponding to the real Car2Go specifications
described in Chapter ref:sec-data-car2go. Further, we fixed the unknown
prediction accuracy of the fleets available charging power $\fPhat{}$ to an
estimate of modern forecast algorithms performance. The impact of the
predictions uncertainty on the results will later be determined in a sensitivity
analysis.

** Integrated Bidding Strategy
# NOTE: Additional bar-plot with monthly increasing profits?
In Research Question 1, we investigate whether a fleet operator can use a VPP
portfolio of EVs to profitably bid on multiple electricity markets. In Chapter
ref:sec-model-mechanism, we proposed a central control mechanism that charges
the fleet with an integrated bidding strategy, which we will evaluate in the
following section.

Table ref:table-sim-stats shows a statistic about the fleet utilization in a
simulation run, with data from June 1, 2016 to January 1, 2018. It can be
observed that (a) the volatility of EVs parked at a charging station is
remarkably high (large standard deviation), and (b) the fraction of EVs that can
be utilized for VPP activities is diminishing low (3.55%). It is apparent that a
high uncertainty and the low share of EVs that can possibly generate profits are
challenging the economic sustainability of our proposed model.

#+CAPTION[Fleet Utilzation]: Daily fleet utilization (average, standard deviation) from June 1, 2016 to January 1, 2018. The blue error band is illustrating the large volatility in the amount of EVs that get parked at a charging station. The share of EVs that can be used as VPP is on average only 3.55% of the fleet's size. Most of the EVs are either not connected to a charging station or are already fully charged.

In order to evaluate the proposed strategy, we defined several "naive" bidding
strategy to compare the performance against other strategies. The strategies are
naive in that sense, that they are assuming a fixed risk associated with bidding
at a specific electricity market. As opposed to the developed RL agent (next
chapter), they do not take information of their environment into account and
adjust the bidding quantities dynamically. Instead the controller discounts the
predicted amount of with a fixed risk factor $\lambda$ (c.f.,
\eqref{eq-model-pb} and \eqref{eq-model-pi}). Naturally, the controller
estimates a higher risk for bidding on the balancing market week ahead than on
the intraday market 30 minutes ahead. We defined following types of strategies:
1) Risk-averse ($\lb{}\!=\!0.5$, $\li{}\!=\!0.3$)

   The controller avoids denying rentals and causing imbalances at all costs. In
   order to not commit more charging power that it can provide, it places only
   bids for conservative amounts of electricity on the markets. The risk averse
   strategies /Balancing/ and /Intraday/ are comparable to similar strategies
   developed by
   cite:kahlen17_fleet,kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem.

2) Risk-seeking ($\lb{}\!=\!0.2$, $\li{}\!=\!0.0$)

   The controller aims to maximize it's profits, by trading as much electricity
   on the markets as possible. It strives to fully utilize the VPP and allocate
   a high percentage of available EVS to charge from the markets. Due to the
   rental uncertainty and a low estimated risk, the controller is prone to
   offering more charging power to the markets that it can provide. This may
   lead to lost rental costs or even imbalances.

3) Full information

   The benchmark strategy, where the controller knows the bidding risks in
   advance and places the perfect bids on the markets, while still accounting
   for the prediction uncertainty. On other words, it charges the maximal amount
   of electricity from the markets without having to deny rentals or causing
   imbalances. This reference strategy is the optimal solution to the problem.

# NOTE: Mention numbers?
In Table ref:table-profits, the simulation results of all tested strategies are
listed. We can see that the /Integrated (risk-averse)/ strategy outperforms its
single market counterparts. As expected, the controller is able to better
utilize the VPP by buying more electricity from the markets. It is able to
capitalize on the most favorable market conditions and generate on average
49%-54% more profits than the single market strategies. With the integrated
strategy the fleet pays on average $0.10 \ekwh$ less than other risk averse
strategies.

A controller with an /Integrated (risk-seeking)/ strategy, is even more
profitable, despite having to account for lost rental profits. On the other
side, the controller caused imbalances (highlighted red) which lead to high
(unknown) market penalties or even exclusion from bidding activities. Therefore,
imbalances need to be avoided, regardless of potential profits. We expect that
the proposed RL agent learns a bidding strategy, which avoids imbalances while
increasing profits, with an upper bound of the benchmark strategy /Integrated
(full information)/.

# TODO: Explain VPP Utilization?
# TODO: Risk-seeking should be lower, here: profits from buying energy, which
# could be charged from imbalances or lost rentals are still included.

** Reinforcement Learning Portfolio Optimization
# NOTE: What about confidence intervals - Mean?

Research Question 2 investigates whether a RL agent can optimize the integrated
bidding strategy by dynamically adjusting the bidding quantities. The bidding
quantities $\Pb{}, \Pi{}$ are based on the evaluated risk associated with
bidding on the individual electricity markets. In Chapter ref:sec-model-rl, we
proposed a RL approach that learns the risk factors $\lb{}$, $\li{}$ based on
its observed environment and received reward signals.

To let the agent learn to always avoid imbalances, we set the imbalance costs
$\beta$ to the imbalance (MW) times an artificially high value of 10000 $\emwh$.
Whenever the agents causes imbalances, it will receive a highly negative reward
signal, leading to low estimated Q-values in that timestep.

# NOTE: Present hyperparameters for RL approach
# - cite:chis16_reinf_learn_based_plug_in
Table III presents the values of all parameters of the fitted Q-iteration
algorithm used for solving the proposed PEV charging problem. These values were
found experimentally for the PEV charging problem at hand. L1 norm was used for
the calculation of the kernel function. The speed of convergence may also be
used as a criterion for


*** Results:
1) Profits
   - Graph: Cost evolution of the RL portfolio optimization approach benchmarked
     against naive strategies (w/ error band)
   - Graph cumulative (charging) profits over 1 simulation run, w/ learned RL agent (over
     how many iterations?)
   - Regular charging comparison? (VPP share is too low?)
   - Graph: Cumulative charging costs over simulation run (days)
     Fig. 4. Comparison of charging costs between the proposed novel charging
     strategy and other three charging strategies. The average cost values and the
     variance intervals of the methods are presented. The proposed novel method
     reduces the costs of charging by roughly 50% when compared with the
     conventional charging method and by roughly 10% when compared with a
     daily optimal charging strategy. To reach the global optimal solution the cost
     would need to be reduced by X% further.

2) Learning

3) Actions
   - Prob distribution of optimal actions for the fleet during weekdays. cite:vaya14_optim
   - What actions/risk were chosen on average?

*** Problems:
- long-delayed rewards make RL hard (!?)
- positive reward from buying immediately vs negative rewards up to 7 days.

*** Summary:
- In summary, all four experiments show that our approach is
  able to learn a cost-effective day-ahead schedule under varying
  circumstances, without using any a priori information about
  the EVs.

** Sensitivity Analysis
# NOTE: Prediction Accuracy of available EV capacity
# NOTE: Balancing accuracy always lower than intraday! Otherwise no sense
# NOTE: Do predict electricity prices?

# NOTE: Results heavily dependent on industry charging price, since on average
# the balancing prices are 50% cheaper, and intraday 30% cheaper. Perform a run?

*** Prediction Accuracy
- Compare profits of (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%)

*** Charging infrastructure
- Fastchargers (22kw)
- Car batteries
- More Charging Stations (infer charging stations)

*** Bidding Mechanism
# NOTE: Relaxed minimum bidding assumption of 1MW to no limit.
- Minimal bidding quantities (100kw, 500kw, 1MW)

- Environmental impact by providing balancing power
- Decision Support System for controlled EV charging from multiple markets
- RL Algorithm that is designed to work in previously unknown environments and
  thus suited to deploy in real life settings of all kinds of EV fleets in all
  kinds of cities. E.g. scooters also?
- Online learning algorithm (difference? -- real data?)
- Event-based Simulation Platform to evaluate bidding strategies and RL agents,
  facilitate research

** Limitations
# # NOTE: Citatation from kahlen
# The fleet controller offers bids and asks for every time interval. These offers
# contain both a quantity and a reservation price, which depends on the state of
# charge of the EV storage, as well as on the battery costs. However, the market
# may or may not accept these offers depending on the composition of the offer
# prices from the fleet owner and other market participants. The market auction
# mechanism ultimately decides when EVs will charge and discharge.
- Model:
  - Bidding Mechanism: one week ahead, always accepted
  - Policy & Regulation: EVs not allowed to provide balancing power, minimum
    bidding quantities 1MW.
  - Markets: Fleet is a price-taker, what about larger fleets? Simulate market influence
- RL: See cite:vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon conclusion for
  limitations.
