# It is also expected that the amount of intermittent RES
# that can be safely integrated into the electric power system
# may increase due to EV storage capacity [11]. Given the
# uncontrollability of these energy sources, since they only
# produce energy when the primary renewable resource is
# available, EV capability to store energy and inject it later
# into the system will avoid spillage of clean energy,
# resulting in the decreased usage of the conventional fossil

** Smart Charging and Balancing the Electric Grid with EV Fleets
# NOTE: Section General Problem and Intro of Smart Charging
The increasing penetration of EVs has a substantial effect on electricity consumption
patterns. During charging periods, power flows and grid losses increase
considerably and challenge the grid. Operators have to reinforce the grid
to ensure that transformers and substations do not get overloaded
parencite:sioshansi12_impac_elect_tarif_plug_in,lopes11_integ_elect_vehic_elect_power_system.
Loading multiple EVs in the same neighborhood, or worse, whole EV fleets at
once, stress the grid. In these cases, even brown- or blackouts are possible
parencite:kim12_carbit. Despite these challenges, it is possible to postpone the
physical reinforcement by adopting smart charging strategies. In smart charging,
EVs get charged when the grid is less congested to achieve more grid stability.
Smart charging reduces peaks in electricity demand, called /Peak Cutting/ and
complement the grid in times of low demand, called /Valley Filling/. Smart
charging has been researched thoroughly in the IS literature, in the following
we will outline some of the most important contributions.

# NOTE: Section Smart charging examples and studies
textcite:valogianni14_effec_manag_elect_vehic_storag find that using intelligent
agents to schedule EV charging substantially reshapes the energy demand and
reduces peak demand without violating individual household preferences. Moreover,
they show that the proposed smart charging behavior reduced average energy
prices and thus economically benefit households. In another study
textcite:kara15_estim_benef_elect_vehic_smart investigate the effect of smart
charging on public charging stations in California. Controlling for
arrival and departure times, the authors present beneficial results for the
distribution system operator (DSO) and the owners of EVs. A price
reduction in energy bills and a peak load reduction could be determined.
An extension of the smart charging concept is Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). When
equipped with V2G devices, EVs can discharge their batteries back into the grid.
Several authors researched this technology in respect to grid stabilization
effects and arbitrage possibilities.
textcite:schill11_elect_vehic_imper_elect_market find that EVs can be beneficial
for average consumer electricity prices. Excess EV battery capacity can be used
to charge in off-peak hours and discharge in peak hours when the prices are
higher. These arbitrage possibilities reverse welfare effects of generators
and increase general overall welfare and consumer surplus.
textcite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor show that the
arbitrage opportunities are especially prominent when a high variability in
electricity prices on the target electricity market exists. The authors state
that short intervals between the contract of sale and the physical delivery of
electricity increase arbitrage benefits. Consequently, ancillary service markets,
like frequency control and operating reserve markets, are attractive for smart
charging.

# NOTE: Section Not looking at V2G. Explain and prove why leaving out V2G.
textcite:peterson10_econom_using_plug_in_hybrid investigate energy arbitrage
profitability with V2G in the light of battery depreciation costs in the US.
Their results indicate that large-scale use of EV batteries for grid storage
does not yield enough profits to incentivize EV owners to participate in V2G
activities. Considering battery depreciation cost, they arrive at an annual
profit of only 6\dollar - 72\dollar per EV.
textcite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ evaluated a business
model for parking garage operators operating on the German frequency regulation
market. When taking infrastructure costs and battery depreciation costs into
account, they concluded that the proposed vehicle-grid integration is not
profitable. Even with generous assumptions about EV adoption rates in Germany
and altered auction mechanisms they arrived at negative profits.
textcite:kahlen17_fleet used EV fleets to offer balancing services to the grid.
Evaluating the impact of V2G in their model the authors conclude that V2G would
only be profitable if reserve power prices would be twice as high. Given the
results from the studies mentioned above, we decided not to include V2G into our
model, since expected profits are marginal.

# NOTE: Section Trading strategies on multiple markets, battery depreciation
In order to maximize profits, it is essential for market participants to develop good
bidding strategies. Successful bidding strategies to jointly participate in
multiple markets have been developed, e.g., by
textcite:mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2. The authors use
stationary battery storage to participate in the spinning reserve market and
the day-ahead market at the same time. They developed a non-equilibrium model,
which solves the presented mixed-integer program with Genetic Programming (GP).
Contrarily, we use a model-free RL agent that learns an optimal policy (i.e.,
a trading strategy) from actions it takes in the environment (i.e., bidding on
electricity markets). Using a model-free approach is especially beneficial for
us, since additional unknown variables and constraints (i.e., customer mobility
demand), make it complicated to formulate a mathematical model.
# TODO: Revise above paragraph, more clarity and concise
textcite:he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag have done similar research to
textcite:mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2. The authors additionally
incorporate battery life cycle in their profit maximization model,
which proves to be a decisive factor. In contrast to the authors, we jointly
participated in the secondary operating reserve and spot market with the
/non-stationary/ storage of EV batteries. Because shared EVs have to satisfy
mobility demands, they have to be charged in any case, which allows us to safely
exclude battery deprecation from our model. Further, we chose the intraday
market over the day-ahead market, as it has the lowest reaction time of the spot
markets, and thus potentially offers higher profits
parencite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor.

# NOTE: Section Intelligent Agents within Smart Charging
# TODO: Extend section on intelligent agents and electricity brokers, state that
# we are applying this concept with VPP on top.
Previous studies often assume that car owners or households can directly trade
on electricity markets. In reality, this is not possible due to the minimum
capacity requirements of the markets, that single EVs do not meet. For example,
the German Control Reserve Market (GCRM) has a minimum trading capacity of 1MW
to 5MW, depending on the specific market. In order to reach the minimum
capacity, over 200 EVs would need to be connected to the grid via a standard
4.6kW charging station at the same time. textcite:ketter13_power_tac introduced
the notion of electricity brokers, aggregators that act on behalf of a group of
individuals or households to participate in electricity markets.
textcite:brandt17_evaluat_busin_model_vehic_grid_integ and
textcite:kahlen14_balan_with_elect_vehic successfully showed in their studies
that electricity brokers could overcome the capacity issues by aggregating EV
batteries. In addition to electricity brokers, we apply the concept of Virtual
Power Plants (VPPs). VPPs are flexible portfolios of distributed energy
resources, which are presented with a single load profile to the system
operator, making them eligible for market participation and ancillary service
provisioning parencite:pudjianto07_virtual_power_plant_system_integ. Hence, VPPs
allow providing regulation capacity to the market without knowing which exact
sources provide the promised capacity until the delivery time
parencite:kahlen17_fleet. This concept is specially useful when dealing with
EV fleets: VPPs enable carsharing providers to issue bids and asks based on an
estimate of available fleet capacity, without knowing beforehand which exact EVs
will provide the capacity at the time of delivery. Based on the battery charge
and the availability EVs, an intelligent agent will decide in real-time which
vehicles provide the capacity.
# NOTE: Section Carsharing and EV fleets
Carsharing providers manage large EV fleets, which makes it possible for them to
use the presented concepts as a viable business extension. We look at free float
carsharing, a popular concept where cars can be picked up and parked everywhere,
and billing is done by the minute. Free float carsharing offers more flexibility
to its users, saves resources and reduces carbon emissions
parencite:firnkorn15_free_float_elect_carsh_fleet_smart_cities. Most previous
studies concerned with using EVs for electricity trading, assumed that trips are
fixed and known in advance, e.g., in
textcite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor. The free float
concept adds uncertainty and nondeterministic behavior, which make predictions
about future rentals a complex issue.
# NOTE: Section Kahlen in more detail and what we'll do differently
textcite:kahlen17_fleet showed that it is possible to use free float carsharing
fleets as VPPs to profitably offer balancing services to the grid. The authors
compared cases from three different cities across Europe and the US.
They used an event-based simulation, bootstrapped with real-world carsharing
and secondary operating reserve market data from the respective cities, to
arrive at their results. A central dilemma within this research is to decide
whether an EV should be committed to a VPP or to be free for rent, in the core a
classification problem. Since rental profits are considerably higher than
profits from electricity trading, it is crucial not to allocate an EV to a VPP
when it could have been rented out otherwise. To deal with the asymmetric
payoff, citeauthor:kahlen17_fleet use stratified sampling in their classifier.
This method gives rental misclassifications higher weights, which reduces the
likelihood of EVs to participate in VPP activities. The authors use a Random
Forest regression model to predict the available balancing capacity, which they
use to place bids and asks on the market. An agent predicts available capacity
on an aggregated fleet level, in order to leverage risk-pooling effects. Only at
the delivery time the agent decides which EVs will provide the regulation
capacity based on the likelihood that the vehicle is rented out and on the
expected benefits of the EV. In a similar study, the authors showed that
carsharing companies could participate in day-ahead markets for arbitrage
purposes parencite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem. In this
paper, the authors use a time-series model to predict available trading
capacity, due to less time between commitment and delivery. Another central
problem for the carsharing provider is that committed trades which can not be
fulfilled result in substantial penalties from the system operator or
electricity exchange. In other words, it should be avoided at all costs, that
the fleet commits to buy any amount of electricity, for which it does not have
enough available EVs to charge it at the delivery time. To address this issue,
the authors develop a mean asymmetric weighted (MAW) objective function. They
use it for their time-series based prediction model, to penalize committing an
EV to VPP when it would have been rented out otherwise. Because of the two
issues mentioned above, textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem
can only make very conservative estimations and commitments of overall available
trading capacity, which results in a high amount of foregone profits. This
effect is especially prominent when participating in the secondary operating
reserve market since commitments have to be made one week in advance when
mobility demands are still uncertain. textcite:kahlen17_fleet state that in 42%
to 80% of the cases EVs are /not/ committed to a VPP when it would have been
profitable to do so.
# NOTE: Section Short summary what we will do
# TODO: Rework
This research is proposing a solution, in which the EV fleet participates in the
balancing market and intraday market simultaneously. With this approach, we
align the potentially higher profits on the balancing markets, already mentioned
by textcite:tomic07_using_fleet_elect_drive_vehic_grid_suppor, with more
accurate capacity predictions for intraday markets. We followed
textcite:kahlen17_fleet with this approach, who proposed to work on a combination
of multiple markets in the future.

** Reinforcement Learning in Smart Grids

Previous research showed that intelligent agents equipped with Reinforcement
Learning methods can successfully take action in the smart grid. The following
chapter outlines different research approaches of RL in the domain of smart
grids. For a more thorough description, mathematical formulations and common
issues of RL refer to Chapter ref:reinforcement-learning.

textcite:reddy11_learn_behav_multip_auton_agent,reddy11_strat use autonomous
broker agents to buy and sell electricity from DER on a proposed /Tariff
Market/. The agents uses Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and RL to learn pricing
strategies to profitably participate in the Tariff Market. To control for a
large number of possible states in the domain, the authors used /Q-Learning/
with derived state space features. Based on descriptive statistics, they define
derived price and market participant features. By engaging with its
environment, the agent learns an optional sequence of actions (policy) based on
a the states. textcite:peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton build on that work
and further enhance the method, by using function approximation. Function
approximation allows to efficiently learn strategies over large state spaces, by
deriving a function that describes the states instead of defining discrete
states. Using this technique, the agent is able adapt to arbitrary economic
signals from its environment, which resulted in better performance than previous
approaches. Moreover, the authors applied feature selection and regularization
methods to explore the agents adaption process. These methods are particularly
beneficial in smart markets because market design, structures, and conditions
might change in the future, hence intelligent agents should be able to adapt to
it parencite:peters13_reinf_learn_approac_to_auton.

textcite:vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet use RL to learn collective EV
fleet charging behavior to profitably purchase electricity on the day-ahead
market. Similar to textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem the
problem is framed from the viewpoint of the aggregator which tries to define a
cost-effective day-ahead charging plan in the absence of knowing EV charging
parameters, like departure time. A crucial point of the study is weighting low
charging prices versus imbalance costs that have to be paid when an excessive or
insufficient  amount of electricity is bought from the market. Contrarily,
textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem don't consider imbalance
cost in their model and avoid them by always sacrificing EV mobility in order to
balance the market. textcite:vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet use a
/fitted Q Iteration/ to control for continuous variables in their state and
action space. In order to achieve faster convergence, they additionally optimize
the /temperature step/ parameter of the Boltzmann exploration probability.

RL an optimal fit for the design of our proposed intelligent agent, especially
as a solution for our Research Question 2. When dynamically optimizing the VPP
portfolio composition of the fleet, there is no historical data available to
train a model. Using RL and a reward function that maximizes the overall
profitability of the fleet, the agent can learn from its environment with
unknown dynamics and take a certain set of actions. The agent can consider
different states (e.g., current and forecasted rental demand levels and
electricity prices) to take actions (e.g., allocate battery capacity to
different types of VPPs) that maximizes the reward function.
