* Simulation Platform: FleetSim
# NOTE: 5%
# NOTE: Cite Ketter PowerTac (and Competitive Benchmarking)
- Simulation Platform to allow evaluating the performance of intelligent agents
  in smart charging/balancing the grid of EV fleets. Allows to test out bidding strategies
  and control mechanisms in a realistic EV fleet setting.
- Real life comparison graph: 10%.
** Event-based Simulation
- Not only t+1
- Event e.g. denying rental, charge/little charge/no-charge has effects for the
  whole simulation
- Simpy
- Python
** Architecture / Components
#+CAPTION[FleetSim Architecture]: Architecture of FleetSim label:fig-fleetsim
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\linewidth
# [[./fig/simulation_platform.png]]

** Modular Expandability
- Plug-in different Market designs
- Use different real-world data
- Change Fleet parameters
- Develop new strategy
-

* Results
# NOTE: 15%
# NOTE: What about infer charging stations?
# - Run regular with charging stations
# - Run strategy with no/less regular charging
# NOTE: Also include overview graphs, of charging, prices, available capacity,
# car2go trips, etc..
# NOTE: Include overview graphs of different RL methods over time
# NOTE: List Simulation params in a table: Car Capacity etc..
# NOTE: Make decision outcome results table over one-year period like kahlen
# NOTE: Include EUR/MWh provided!
** Simulation Settings
# NOTE: Include Graph of electricity prices
- Results heavily dependent on industry charging price, since on average the
  balancing prices are 50% cheaper, and intraday 30% cheaper.
- BMWi. (n.d.). Prices of electricity for the industry in Germany from 2008 to
  2017 (in euro cents per kilowatt hour). In Statista - The Statistics Portal.

** FleetRL
- long-delayed rewards make RL hard (!?)
- Compare RL Algos eg. Q-learning vs DDQN --> deep learning makes difference in
  practice for complex system
- How much could have been used as VPP optimally/perfect information? Similar matrix to Kahlen, or even plot?
** Sensitivity Analysis
# NOTE: Prediction Accuracy of available EV capacity
# NOTE: Balancing accuracy always lower than intraday! Otherwise no sense
# NOTE: Do predict electricity prices?
- Prediction Accuracy
# NOTE: Fastchargers
# NOTE: Car batteries
- Charging infrastructure
* Conclusion
# NOTE 5%
** Contribution
- Compare to most simular studies:
cite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem,vandael15_reinf_learn_heuris_ev_fleet etc..
- Business model for EV fleet owners with better results than previous studies
- Environmental impact by providing balancing power
- Decision Support System for controlled EV charging from multiple markets
- RL Algorithm that is designed to work in previously unknown environments and
  thus suited to deploy in real life settings of all kinds of EV fleets in all
  kinds of cities. E.g. scooters also?
- Event-based Simulation Platform to evaluate bidding strategies and RL agents,
  facilitate research

** Limitations
- Model:
  - Bidding Mechanism: one week ahead, always accepted
  - Policy & Regulation: EVs not allowed to provide balancing power, minimum
    bidding quantities 1MW.
  - Markets: Fleet is a price-taker, what about larger fleets? Simulate market influence
- RL: See cite:vazquez-canteli19_reinf_learn_deman_respon conclusion for
  limitations.
** Future Research
- Model: Current market design, i.e. daily w/ 4h slots. German "Mischpreisverfahren"
- RL: Long-delayed rewards, different reward structure, memory based
