* Introduction (1-2 Pages)
** Research Motivation
The global climate change is one biggest challenges of our time. Carbon
emissions need to be reduced and the shift to sustainable energy sources is
inevitable. But integration of renewables into the electricity
grid proves to be difficult: Solar and wind energy is intermittent and hard
to integrate into the power grid. Sustainable electricity production is dependent
on the weather, under- and oversupplies occur and destabilize the grid.
# TODO: Make introduction coherent
# Electric vehicles (EV) powered by sustainable energy sources are
# Connection, Also Smart Sustainable Markets?
# The future of mobility is autonomous, connected, electric and shared.

Virtual power plants (VPP) play an important role in stabilizing the grid.
VPPs aggregate distributed power sources to consume and produce electricity when
it is needed. Carsharing companies operate large, centrally-managed fleets of
electric vehicles (EV) in major cities around the world. These EV fleets can be
turned into VPPs, using their batteries as combined electricity storage.
In this way EV fleets can offer balancing services to the power grid or trade
electricity on the open markets for arbitrage purposes.
# Rewrite
Carsharing companies can charge the fleet (buy electricity), when there is an excess of
electricity and discharge EVs (sell electricity), when there is a shortage of electricity.
By making their EVs available to be used as a VPP, carsharing companies
compromise customer mobility and the profitability of their fleet. Renting out
an EV to a customer is considerably more lucrative than using it for trading electricity.

Knowing how many EVs will most likely be rented out in a future point of time
and consequently obtaining an accurate forecast of available battery capacity is essential
for a successful trading strategy. Moreover it possible for fleet owners to trade on
multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Electricity markets differ in
price elasticity, as well as reaction time between contractual agreement and
physical delivery.

# TODO: Citation needed
Participating in operating reserve markets and spot markets at the same time
can mitigates risks and increase profits. Allocating EVs to different types of VPPs, that
participate on the respective markets is an optimization problem, which can be solved.

In this research we propose an portfolio optimizing strategy, in which the best
composition of the VPP portfolio, consisting of operating reserve
VPPs and spot market VPPs, will be dynamically determined. To address changing
electricity price levels and customer demands over time we additionally propose an
the use of intelligent agent trading strategy, in which an agent learns from historical data
and adjust to its current environment.
The following tasks will be performed by the agent in real time: 1) /Allocation of plugged in
EVs to idle or VPP state/, 2) /Learn the optimum of VPP portfolio
composition/ 3) /Place bids and asks on corresponding electricity markets with an
integrated trading strategy/.

** Research Question
Drawing upon the research motivation, the following research questions are derived.
They build upon another and will be sequentially addressed during this research:

1. /What are spatio-temporal customer demand patterns of carsharing EVs?/

  Knowing customer demand patterns results in an accurate forecast of how much
  available battery capacity an EV fleet will have at any point in time.

2. /What is the optimal allocation ratio of the available capacity between operating
  reserve market VPPs and spot market VPPs?/

  Dynamically learning the optimal share of capacity to trade on the
  respective markets will maximize profits, while reducing the risk of foregone
  customer profits.

  # TODO: Introduce specific markets
3. /How does an integrated bidding strategy look like, which considers trading electricity
    the secondary operating reserve market and the continuous intraday market simultaneously?/

   Designing a strategy and determine optimal auction prices, which takes the specific market
   designs of the German secondary operating reserve market and continuous intraday market into account.


** Relevance of the Research
*** Relevance to Practice

From a business perspective this research is mainly relevant to carsharing
companies, such as Car2Go or DriveNow, which are operating an EV fleet. We will show how
these companies can increase their profits, using idle EVs as VPPs to trade
electricity on multiple markets simultaneously.

# TODO: Consider notion of different (mutually exclusive states)
# TODO: DSS not introduced yet
We propose the use of a decision support system (DSS), which allocates idle EVs to either type of VPP or to be available for renting. Moreover it will determine optimal ask, bids and capacities to trade on the individual electricity markets.

# TODO: Different Section?
Further, we will evaluate the profitability of such methods, using real-world data from German electricity markets and trip data from a carsharing provider.

*** Relevance to Science

From a scientific perspective this research is relevant to the stream of agent-based decision making in smart markets (Peters et al. 2013, Bichler et al. 2010). We will contribute to the body of Design Science in Information Systems (Hevner et. al.) and draw upon work done in multitude of fields: Virtual Power Plants in smart electricity markets, carsharing as a new way of sustainable mobility and advanced machine learning methods for forecasting and prediction.

There has been work done on bidding on multiple energy markets at the same time. He et al. (2016) and Mashour and Moghaddas-Trafreshi (2011) use stationary storage developed optimal bidding strategies for jointly participating in day-ahead and spinning-reserver markets. We aim to use non-stationary storage (EV batteries) to participate in the continous intraday market and the secondary reserve market (known as real-time market in the US).

Kahlen present very conversative results and propose the combination of multiple markets in future work. In their approach the VPPs are mainly used to buy from the markets when electricity is cheap and thus charge their EVs basically for free (Citatation). V2G is almost never used... . We aim to...

** Electricity Markets
*** Operating reserve market
offer higher profits, due to a very low reaction time
 between contractual agreement and physical delivery. They also bear a higher risk for the
 fleet. Commitments have to be made one week in advance, where customer demands
 are uncertain. To not face penalties for unfulfilled commitments, only a
 conservative estimation of available battery capacity can be made. This leaves
 a lot of potential EV capacity unused.

applicable to all of Germany

POS-HT = Product code for positive secondary
control reserve to be provided between the hours of 08:00h and 20:00h from
Monday through Friday.

*** Continuous intraday market
 allow participants to continuously trade electricity products up
 to 15 minutes prior to delivery (in Germany). At this point it is possible to
 predict customer demand with a high accuracy, which generates the possibility
 to trade the remaining available capacity with a low risk.

* Research Design (1-2 Pages)
The research will be structured using the IS design science principles proposed by Hevner et
al. (2004). In Figure ref:research-design the proposed research design is depicted.
We will place a special focus on the used methodologies, the developed artifact
and the evaluation of the results.
Drawing from the /Knowledge Base/, multiple methods will be compared and evaluated against each
other and thus emphasising /Research Rigor/. Considering /Business Needs/, we
will develop an /Artifact/ in form of a decision support system. Evaluating
the results with real-world data with a simulation will make sure the /Artifact/
is /applicable in the appropriate environment/ (i.e. carsharing fleets).
