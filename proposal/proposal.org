* Introduction
** Research Motivation
The global climate change is one biggest challenges of our time. Carbon
emissions need to be reduced and the shift to sustainable energy sources is
inevitable. But integration of renewables into the electricity
grid proves to be difficult: Solar and wind energy is intermittent and hard
to integrate into the power grid. Sustainable electricity production is dependent
on the weather, under- and oversupplies occur and destabilize the grid.
# TODO: Make introduction coherent
# Electric vehicles (EV) powered by sustainable energy sources are
# Connection, Also Smart Sustainable Markets?
# The future of mobility is autonomous, connected, electric and shared.

Virtual power plants (VPP) play an important role in stabilizing the grid.
VPPs aggregate distributed power sources to consume and produce electricity when
it is needed. Carsharing companies operate large, centrally-managed fleets of
electric vehicles (EV) in major cities around the world. These EV fleets can be
turned into VPPs, using their batteries as combined electricity storage.
In this way EV fleets can offer balancing services to the power grid or trade
electricity on the open markets for arbitrage purposes.
# Rewrite
Carsharing companies can charge the fleet (buy electricity), when there is an excess of
electricity and discharge EVs (sell electricity), when there is a shortage of electricity.
By making their EVs available to be used as a VPP, carsharing companies
compromise customer mobility and the profitability of their fleet. Renting out
an EV to a customer is considerably more lucrative than using it for trading electricity.

Knowing how many EVs will most likely be rented out in a future point of time
and consequently obtaining an accurate forecast of available battery capacity is essential
for a successful trading strategy. Moreover it is possible for fleet owners to trade on
multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Electricity markets differ in
price elasticity, as well as reaction time between contractual agreement and
physical delivery.

# TODO: Citation needed
Participating in operating reserve markets and spot markets at the same time
can mitigates risks and increase profits. Allocating EVs to different types of VPPs, that
participate on the respective markets is an optimization problem, which we aim to solve.

In this research we propose a portfolio optimizing strategy, in which the best
composition of the VPP portfolio, consisting of operating reserve
VPPs and spot market VPPs, will be dynamically determined. To address changing
electricity price levels and customer demands over time we additionally propose an
the use of intelligent agent trading strategy, in which an agent learns from historical data
and adjust to its current environment.

The following tasks will be performed by the agent in real time: 1) /Allocation of plugged in
EVs to idle or VPP state/, 2) /Learn the optimum of VPP portfolio
composition/ and 3) /Place bids and asks on corresponding electricity markets with an
integrated trading strategy/.

** Research Question
Drawing upon the research motivation, the following research questions are derived.
They build upon another and will be sequentially addressed during this research:

1. /What are spatio-temporal customer demand patterns of carsharing EVs?/

  Knowing customer demand patterns results in an accurate forecast of how much
  available battery capacity an EV fleet will have at any point in time.

2. /What is the optimal allocation ratio of the available capacity between operating
  reserve market VPPs and spot market VPPs?/

  Dynamically learning the optimal share of capacity to trade on the
  respective markets will maximize profits, while reducing the risk of foregone
  customer profits.

  # TODO: Introduce specific markets
3. /How does an integrated bidding strategy look like, which considers trading electricity
    the secondary operating reserve market and the continuous intraday market simultaneously?/

   Designing a strategy and determine optimal auction prices, which takes the specific market
   designs of the German secondary operating reserve market and continuous intraday market into account.


* Relevance of the Research
** Relevance to Practice

From a business perspective this research is mainly relevant to carsharing
companies, such as Car2Go or DriveNow, which are operating an EV fleet. We will show how
these companies can increase their profits, using idle EVs as VPPs to trade
electricity on multiple markets simultaneously.

# TODO: Consider notion of different (mutually exclusive states)
# TODO: DSS not introduced yet
We propose the use of a decision support system (DSS), which allocates idle EVs to either type of VPP or to be available for renting. Furthermore the DSS will determine optimal ask, bids and capacities to trade on the individual electricity markets.

# TODO: Different Section?
In addition, we will estimate the profitability increase, when implementing the proposed methods.
This will be done using real-world data from German electricity markets and trip data from a German carsharing provider.

** Relevance to Science

From a scientific perspective this research is relevant to the stream of agent-based decision making in smart markets parencite:bichler10_resear_commen_desig_smart_market,peters2013reinforcement. We will contribute to the body of Design Science in Information Systems parencite:hevner04_desig_scien_infor_system_resear and draw upon work done in multitude of research areas: Virtual Power Plants in smart electricity markets parencite:pudjianto07_virtual_power_plant_system_integ, carsharing as a new way of sustainable mobility and advanced machine learning methods for forecasting and prediction.

Similar research has been carried out by textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem and textcite:kahlen17_fleet. In their research the authors concentrate on participating in one type of electricity market at a time. As proposed by citeauthor:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem we will take this research further and use the EV VPPs to act on multiple types of electricity markets simultaneously. Moreover we aim to use sophisticated machine learning methods (i.e. recurrent neural networks, ensemble learning) to carry out more accurate forecasts of rental demand and dynamically learn allocation ratios to the individual markets.

textcite:he16_optim_biddin_strat_batter_storag and textcite:mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_2,mashhour11_biddin_strat_virtual_power_plant_1 researched on optimal bidding strategies for using VPPs to jointly bid on multiple markets. The authors use stationary storage to participate in day-ahead and spinning-reserve markets. Contrarily, we aim to use non-stationary storage (i.e. EV batteries) to participate in the continuous intraday market and the secondary reserve market (known as real-time market in the US).

** Relevance to Society

This research contributes to the overall welfare of the society in three points. First, VPPs of EVs provide extra balancing services to the power grid. The VPPs can consume excess electricity (almost) instantly and stabilize the power grid like this. When integrating more intermittent renewable electricity sources into the grid in the future, such balancing services will become indispensable.
# As opposed to idle-power plants or gas turbines
Second, a reduction of electricity prices for the end-consumer is expected. Integrating VPPs into the power grid increases the efficiency of the whole system and hence is  lowering prices. textcite:kahlen18_elect_vehic_virtual_power_plant_dilem show results, where electricity prices decrease up to 3.4% on the wholesale market. We anticipate similar results in our research.

# TODO: Explain what curtailment means. Explain merit order, low marginal costs
Third, VPPs can lead to a decrease in CO_2 emissions. With an increasing share of renewable energy production, the supply of sustainable electricity can excess total electricity demand at times of good weather conditions. The VPPs can consume this electricity by charging the EV fleet and the sustainable energy production does not need to be curtailed. The EV fleet can then feed the electricity back into the grid, when there is more demand than sustainable electricity production. With this mechanism the total CO_2 emissions can be reduced.

* Empirical Setting (1 Page)

# Sustainable energies
We chose to embed our research in the German market. Germany has a comparably high share of renewables in its energy mix and is pushing for a energy turnaround[fn:energiewende] (German: /Energiewende/) since 2010.
# TOOD: Citation
The high renewable energy content in the energy mix causes electricity prices to be more volatile, which makes Germany an attractive location for the use of VPPs.
We obtained real-world trip data from Daimlers carsharing service Car2Go[fn::https://www.car2go.com] and electricity market data from European power exchange EPEX SPOT[fn::https://www.epexspot]. Additionally we collected data from the German electricity market operator regelleistung.net[fn::https://www.regelleistungen.net].

** Carsharing Fleets of Electric Vehicles

We think that the future of mobility will be electric, shared, smart and eventually autonomous. Carsharing companies are already contributing to the first two points by operating large fleets of electric vehicles. This research addresses the third point: Using EV fleets to smartly participate on electricity markets, without compromising customer mobility.
Carsharing providers like Daimler and BMW operate their carsharing fleets in a free-float model, where people can pick up and drop vehicles at any place withing the operating zone of the provider. Customers pay by the minute and are offered incentives to park EVs at charging stations. Analyzing free float trip data is substantially more difficult as trip data, which are bounded by fixed stations. Individual trips have to be reconstructed using the GPS data of the cars and predicting the rental demand is a complex matter. The demand differs depending at which place and at what time the EVs are parked.
The dataset consists of 500 EVs in the German city Stuttgart. As displayed in Table ref:car2go-sample-data the data contain spatio-temporal attributes, such as timestamp, coordinates and address of the EVs. Additionally status attributes of the interior and exterior are given, the percentual state of charge and information whether the EV is plugged into one of the 200 charging stations in Stuttgart.

** Electricity Markets

On electricity markets actors participate in auctions to match supply of electricity generation and demand of electricity consumption. Participants place asks (sale offers) and bids (purchase orders). The price is determined by an auction mechanism, which can take different forms, depending on the type of market. Germany, as many other countries, has an liberalized energy system in which the generation and distribution of electricity is decoupled. Multiple electricity markets exists, which differ in their reaction time between the order contract and the delivery of electricity. Day-ahead and spot markets have a reaction time between a day and several hours, whereas in operating reserve markets the reaction time ranges from minutes to seconds.

The auction mechanism design is essential for electric markets parencite:kambil98_reeng_dutch_flower_auction. Electricity markets work according to the merit order principle. Resources are considered in an ascending order of the energy price until the capacity demand is met. The clearing price is determined by the energy price, at the point where supply meets demand. Payment models differ in the markets: In contrast to day-ahead market, where a uniform pricing schema is applied, in secondary reserve markets and intraday markets bidders get compensated by the price they bid for (pay-as-bid principle).

# TODO: Infrastructure constraints, not possible to offer EV batteries to the operating reserve market
Carsharing Fleets can offer the capacity of their EV batteries on multiple markets at the same time to make use of the different market properties. On operating reserve markets prices are usually more volatile and consequently more attractive for VPPs. But they also bear a higher risk for the fleet. Commitments have to be made one week in advance, where customer demands are still of uncertain. To not face penalties for unfulfilled commitments only a conservative amount of capacity can be offered to the market. Spot markets allow participants to continuously trade electricity products up to fifteen minutes prior to delivery. At this point it is possible to predict if a EV is likely going to be rented out with a high accuracy. This creates the possibility to trade the remaining available capacity with a low risk at the spot market.

*** Secondary Operating Reserve Market
In this research we will use bidding data from the German secondary reserve market between 01.06.2016 and 01.01.2018. The data contain weekly lists of anonymized bids, where the electricity product, the offered capacity, the capacity price and the energy price of the placed bids are listed. As also negative prices are allowed, the payment direction is included as well. Moreover we find information about which amount of electricity accepted, i.e. either partially or fully. Bids which weren't accepted are not listed. An excerpt of the data can be found in Table ref:operating-reserve-market-sample-data.
