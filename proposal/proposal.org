* Introduction (1-2 Pages)
** Research Motivation
The global climate change is one biggest challenges of our time. Carbon
emissions need to be reduced and the shift to sustainable energy sources is
inevitable. But integration of renewables into the electricity
grid proves to be difficult. Solar and wind energy is intermittent and hard
to integrate into the power grid, which has to be balanced at all times.
Sustainable electricity production is dependent on the weather, under- and
oversupplies occur and destabilize the grid.
# Electric vehicles (EV) powered by sustainable energy sources are
# Connection, Also Smart Sustainable Markets?
# The future of mobility is autonomous, connected, electric and shared.

Virtual power plants (VPP) play an important role in stabilizing the grid.
VPPs aggregate distributed power sources to consume and produce electricity when
it is needed. Carsharing companies operate large, centrally-managed fleets of
electric vehicles (EV) in major cities around the world. These EV fleets can be
turned into VPPs, using their batteries as combined electricity storage.
In this way EV fleets can offer balancing services to the power grid or trade
electricity on the open markets for arbitrage purposes.
# Rewrite
They can charge the fleet (buy electricity), when there is an excess of electricity and discharge EVs (sell
electricity), when there is a shortage of electricity.

By making their EVs available to be used as a VPP, carsharing companies
compromise customer mobility and the profitability of their fleet. Renting out
an EV to a customer is considerably more lucrative than using it for trading electricity.
# ... than using it as a VPP?
Knowing how many EVs will most likely be rented out in a future point of time
and consequently obtaining an accurate forecast of available battery capacity is essential
for a successful trading strategy. Moreover it possible for fleet owners to act on
multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Electricity markets differ in
price elasticity as well as reaction time between contractual agreement and
physical delivery.

# Citation needed
Participating in operating reserve markets and spot markets at the same time
can mitigates risks and increase profits. Allocating EVs to VPPs which
participate on the respective markets is in it's essence an optimization problem.

In this research we propose an portfolio optimizing strategy, in which the best
composition of the VPP portfolio, consisting of operating reserve
VPPs and spot market VPPs, will be dynamically determined. Since electricity
price levels and customer demands change over time, an intelligent agent is
needed that learns from historical data and adjust to its current environment.
The following tasks will be performed in real time: 1) /Allocation of plugged in
EVs to idle or VPP state/, 2) /Learn the optimum of VPP portfolio
composition/ 3) /Place bids and asks on corresponding electricity markets with an
integrated trading strategy/.

** Research Question (!)
In the course of this thesis, following research questions will be addressed.
They sequentially build up onto each other:

1. /How do spatio-temporal customer demand patterns of carsharing EVs look
  like?/

  Knowing customer demand patterns leads to a more accurate forecast of how much
  available battery capacity an EV fleet will have at any point in time.

2. /What is the optimal allocation ratio of the available capacity between operating
  reserve VPPs and spot market VPPs?/

  Dynamically determining the optimal share of capacity to trade on the
  respective markets at any point in time will maximize profits, while reducing
  the risk of foregone customer profits.

3. /How does an integrated bidding strategy look like, which considers simultaneous trading
  electricity at the secondary operating reserve market and the continuous intraday market?/


  Develop an intelligent agent that autonomously acts on operating reserve and
  day-ahead electricity markets with and integrated bidding strategy.

** Relevance of the Research
*** Relevance to Science
- Dynamically optimize the allocation of EVs to different types of VPP using
 recurrent neural networks.

- Application and comparison of Advanced ML Models (for spatial time-series forecasting)
*** Relevance to Practice

- An intelligent agent will be developed, which can be used by carsharing
 providers to dynamically allocate EVs of their fleet to VPPs on different
 electricity markets. The agent will predict available capacity and auction
 prices to profitably act on the operating reserve and continuous intraday
 market. The profitability will be evaluated using real-world data from German
 electricity markets.

** Electricity Markets
 *Operating reserve markets* offer higher profits, due to a very low reaction time
 between contractual agreement and physical delivery. They also bear a higher risk for the
 fleet. Commitments have to be made one week in advance, where customer demands
 are uncertain. To not face penalties for unfulfilled commitments, only a
 conservative estimation of available battery capacity can be made. This leaves
 a lot of potential EV capacity unused.

 *Continuous intraday markets* allow participants to continuously trade electricity products up
 to 15 minutes prior to delivery (in Germany). At this point it is possible to
 predict customer demand with a high accuracy, which generates the possibility
 to trade the remaining available capacity with a low risk.

* Research Design (1-2 Pages)
The research will be structured using the design science principles of Hevner et
al. (2004). In Figure [[Research Design]] the proposed research design is depicted.
We will place a special focus on the used methodologies, the developed artifact
and the evaluation of the results.
Drawing from the /Knowledge Base/, multiple methods will be compared and evaluated against each
other and thus emphasising /Research Rigor/. Considering /Business Needs/, we
will develop an /Artifact/ in form of a fully usable software system. Evaluating
the results with real-world data with a simulation will make sure the /Artifact/
is /applicable in the appropriate environment/, for example carsharing fleets.
