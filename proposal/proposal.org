* Introduction
** Research Motivation
** Research Question (!)
1. Is participating in the continuous intraday electricity market
   a viable business model for EV carsharing fleets?
2. Can sophisticated Machine Learning methods significantly improve the
   effectivity of the proposed strategy?
3. How does the proposed strategy compare to engaging in other types of
   electricity markets? Can viable strategies be developed, which participate in the
   different electricity markets at the same time?
** Relevance of the Research
*** Relevance to Science
- Engaging on the intraday market in the context of VPPs for EV fleets not researched yet
- Different electricity markets not compared yet
- New bidding strategies, when acting on multiple markets on the same time
- Application and comparison of Advanced ML Models (for spatial time-series forecasting)
*** Relevance to Practice
- More profitability for car sharing operators
*** Relevance to Society
- Grid stability and more efficient use of sustainable energies
** Structure of the Research Proposal
* Empirical Setting
- Describe relevance and mechanisms of car-sharing and electricity market auctions
- Show excerpts of the available data and explain.
** Carsharing Fleets
- Car2Go: Berlin, Stuttgart, San Diego, Kopenhagen?
- Drive-now available?
- Use same time span for car data as respective market data (!?)
** Electricity Markets
- Epex Spot Market: Continuous intraday trading data from 2016-2017.
- Also replicate other studies? Or just take results form their papers?
  - Day-ahead market data Nord Pool Spot (ELSPOT) (https://nordpoolspot.com)?
  - Secondary reserve market data from Germany (https://regelleistung.net, https://transnetbw.de), Netherlands
    (https://tennet.eu) and California ISO (https://caiso.com)
