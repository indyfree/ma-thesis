* Introduction (1-2 Pages)
** Research Motivation
One of the biggest challenges of our times is to stop the global warming. The
emission of greenhouse gases needs to be reduced, $C0^2$ being one of the major
factors. Increases usage of sustainable energy source plays an important role and
is inevitable. But the transition to sustainable energy is a wicked problem
[Ketter]. The integration of renewable energy sources into the electricity grid
proves to be difficult. Exogenous factors like wind and sun make them highly
intermittent and thus hard to integrate into the power grid, which has to be
balanced at all times.
# Connection, Also Smart Sustainable Markets?

The future of mobility is autonomous, connected, electric and shared. Carsharing
companies already operate large, centrally-managed fleets of electric vehicles
(EV) in major cities around the world. EV fleets can be turned into virtual power
plants, using their batteries as distributed and aggregated electricity storage.
VPPs take part in balancing out the power grid trough trading electricity on the
open markets. Carsharing companies can profitability act on the electricity
markets, when buying electricity (charging EVs) when there is an excess and
selling electricity (discharging EVs through vehicle-to-grid) when there is
a shortage of electricity in the grid.

By making their EVs available to be used as a VPP, carsharing companies
compromise customer mobility and the profitability of their fleet. Renting out
# ... than using it as a VPP?
an EV is considerably more lucrative than using it for trading electricity.
Knowing how many EVs are likely going to be rented out in a future point of time
and thus obtaining an accurate forecast of available battery capacity is essential
for a successful trading strategy. Moreover it possible for fleet owners to act on
multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Electricity markets differ in
price elasticity as well as reaction time between contractual agreement and
physical delivery.

# Citation needed
Participating in operating reserve markets and spot markets at the same time
can mitigates risks and increase profits. Allocating EVs to VPPs which
participate on the respective markets is in it's essence an optimization problem.

# Explain that the sweet spot changes, depending on price levels and capacity forecasts
In this research we propose an portfolio optimizing strategy, in which the best
composition of the VPP portfolio, consisting of operating reserve
VPPs and spot market VPPs, will be dynamically determined. Since electricity
price levels and customer demands change over time, an intelligent agent is
needed that performs following tasks in real time: 1) Allocation of plugged in
EVs to idle or VPP state, 2) Learning the "sweet spot" of VPP portfolio
composition 3) Placing bids and asks corresponding electricity markets with an
integrated trading strategy.
The agent will be evaluated in an event-based simulation, bootstrapped with
real-world data collected in Germany.




** Research Question (!)
In the course of this thesis, following research questions will be addressed.
They sequentially build up onto each other:

1. /How do spatio-temporal customer demand patterns of carsharing EVs look
   like?/

   Knowing customer demand patterns leads to a more accurate forecast of how much
   available battery capacity an EV fleet will have at any point in time.

2. /What is the optimal allocation ratio of the available capacity between operating
   reserve VPPs and spot market VPPs?/

   Dynamically determining the optimal share of capacity to trade on the
   respective markets at any point in time will maximize profits, while reducing
   the risk of foregone customer profits.

3. /How does an integrated bidding strategy look like, which considers simultaneous trading
   electricity at the secondary operating reserve market and the continuous intraday market?/


   Develop an intelligent agent that autonomously acts on operating reserve and
   day-ahead electricity markets with and integrated bidding strategy.

** Relevance of the Research
*** Relevance to Science
- Dynamically optimize the allocation of EVs to different types of VPP using
  recurrent neural networks.
- In the context of EV VPPs an integrated bidding strategy to ac
- Application and comparison of Advanced ML Models (for spatial time-series forecasting)
*** Relevance to Practice

- An intelligent agent will be developed, which can be used by carsharing
  providers to dynamically allocate EVs of their fleet to VPPs on different
  electricity markets. The agent will predict available capacity and auction
  prices to profitably act on the operating reserve and continuous intraday
  market. The profitability will be evaluated using real-world data from German
  electricity markets.

*** Relevance to Society
- Grid stability through balancing
- Integration of more renewable sources into the energy grid

** Electricity Markets
  *Operating reserve markets* offer higher profits, due to a very low reaction time
  between contractual agreement and physical delivery. They also bear a higher risk for the
  fleet. Commitments have to be made one week in advance, where customer demands
  are uncertain. To not face penalties for unfulfilled commitments, only a
  conservative estimation of available battery capacity can be made. This leaves
  a lot of potential EV capacity unused.

  *Continuous intraday markets* allow participants to continuously trade electricity products up
  to 15 minutes prior to delivery (in Germany). At this point it is possible to
  predict customer demand with a high accuracy, which generates the possibility
  to trade the remaining available capacity with a low risk.

* Research Design (1-2 Pages)
The research will be structured using the design science principles of Hevner et
al. (2004). In Figure [[Research Design]] the proposed research design is depicted.
We will place a special focus on the used methodologies, the developed artifact
and the evaluation of the results.
Drawing from the /Knowledge Base/, multiple methods will be compared and evaluated against each
other and thus emphasising /Research Rigor/. Considering /Business Needs/, we
will develop an /Artifact/ in form of a fully usable software system. Evaluating
the results with real-world data with a simulation will make sure the /Artifact/
is /applicable in the appropriate environment/, for example carsharing fleets.
