* Introduction (1-2 Pages)
** Research Motivation

- C0^2 emissions need to be reduced.
- Transition to sustainable energy sources is a wicked problem.
- Electric Vehicles powered by renewable energy sources is a needed measure to
  reduce emissions.
- Integration of renewables into the energy grid is difficult. Exogenous
  factors like sun and wind make them highly intermittent and thus hard to
  integrate into a power grid, which has to be balanced at all times.
- Carsharing companies have centrally managed EV fleets at their hands that can be
  turned into Virtual Power Plants (VPP). VPPs can be used to balance out excess
  electricity or electricity insufficiency from the grid.
- Using VPPs allows carsharing fleets to profitably act on electricity
  markets. Buying electricity (charge EVs), when prices are low (excess energy) and
  selling electricity (discharge EVs, V2G), when prices are high (energy insufficiency).
- But: The usage of EVs as VPP compromises customer mobility and profitability of
  the fleet.
- Thus: An intelligent Agent is needed, which dynamically allocates parked, plugged-in EVs to be
  used as VPP or stay idle, depending whether an EV is likely going to be rented out and how much
  capacity it has available.
- It is possible to act not only on one electricity market, but on multiple:

  *Operating reserve markets* offer higher profits, due to a very low reaction time
  between contractual agreement and physical delivery. They also bear a higher risk for the
  fleet. Commitments have to be made one week in advance, where customer demands
  are uncertain. To not face penalties for unfulfilled commitments, only a
  conservative estimation of available battery capacity can be made. This leaves
  a lot of potential EV capacity unused.

  *Continuous intraday markets* allow participants to continuously trade electricity products up
  to 15 minutes prior to delivery (in Germany). At this point it is possible to
  predict customer demand with a high accuracy, which generates the possibility
  to trade the remaining available capacity with a low risk.

** Research Question (!)
In the course of this thesis, following research questions will be addressed.
They sequentially build up onto each other:

1. /How do spatio-temporal customer demand patterns of carsharing EVs look
   like?/

   Knowing customer demand patterns leads to a more accurate forecast of how much
   available battery capacity an EV fleet will have at any point in time.

2. /What is the optimal allocation ratio of the available capacity between operating
   reserve VPPs and spot market VPPs?/

   Dynamically determining the optimal share of capacity to trade on the
   respective markets at any point in time will maximize profits, while reducing
   the risk of foregone customer profits.

3. /How does an integrated bidding strategy look like, which considers simultaneous trading
   electricity at the secondary operating reserve market and the continuous intraday market?/


   Develop an intelligent agent that autonomously acts on operating reserve and
   day-ahead electricity markets with and integrated bidding strategy.

** Relevance of the Research
*** Relevance to Science
- Dynamically optimize the allocation of EVs to different types of VPP using
  recurrent neural networks.
- In the context of EV VPPs an integrated bidding strategy to ac
- Application and comparison of Advanced ML Models (for spatial time-series forecasting)
*** Relevance to Practice

- An intelligent agent will be developed, which can be used by carsharing
  providers to dynamically allocate EVs of their fleet to VPPs on different
  electricity markets. The agent will predict available capacity and auction
  prices to profitably act on the operating reserve and continuous intraday
  market. The profitability will be evaluated using real-world data from German
  electricity markets.

*** Relevance to Society
- Grid stability through balancing
- Integration of more renewable sources into the energy grid
* Empirical Setting (1 Pages)
- Describe relevance and mechanisms of car-sharing and electricity market auctions
- Show excerpts of the available data and explain.
- Use same time span for car data as respective market data (!?)

* Research Design (1-2 Pages)
The research will be structured using the design science principles of Hevner et
al. (2004). In Figure [[Research Design]] the proposed research design is depicted.
We will place a special focus on the used methodologies, the developed artifact
and the evaluation of the results.
Drawing from the /Knowledge Base/, multiple methods will be compared and evaluated against each
other and thus emphasising /Research Rigor/. Considering /Business Needs/, we
will develop an /Artifact/ in form of a fully usable software system. Evaluating
the results with real-world data with a simulation will make sure the /Artifact/
is /applicable in the appropriate environment/, for example carsharing fleets.
